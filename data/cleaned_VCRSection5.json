    "1120": "470 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nWith order being read three severall times the Companie seemed greatly amazed at the Proposition, so as no man spake thereunto for a long time. At length Mr. Deputy desired them to bethinke themselves in so waightie a busines what answeare they would give him to returne with to their Lo[rdships] whom their Lo[rdships] would expect upon the Friday followinge; Whereupon it was by divers one after another answeared that the matter was of such consequence and waight as they had noe power to give answeare unto in this Court being but an ordinary Court which by his Ma[jesty's] Letters Patents are onely enhabled to handle and order casuall and perticuler occurrences and accidental matters of lesse consequence and waight, but all waightie affaires and perticulerly all things concerning the manner of Government were restrained by precise words in the Letters Patents to the Quarter Court, wherefore duringe the Patent was in force they might not in this ordinary Court take upon them any such authority to determine such a matter as this being of the highest nature that ever was propounded to them: And hereupon the Letters Patents were called for and found to agree exactly with what had bin alledged: It was also further alledged how inviolably and exactly they had alwayes made their practise answeareable hereunto not takinge liberty to themselves so much as to give a share of land but in a Quarter Court: And further it was alledged that whereas beside the newe Adventurers (which cannot be thought to be lesse then fower or five hundred) and all the Planters in Virginia which are equally enteressed in his Ma[jesty's] graceous Letters Patents there were neare 1000 persons named in the Letters Patents themselves to whome the Graunt was made whereof there was not judged to be thirty present in Court: Wherefore the Companie conceaved themselves even in conscience bound not so sodainely to passe away all their interest but rather to be humble petitioners to their Lo[rdships] upon these just grounds that their Answeare might be respited untill the Quarter Court which was not verie farr off; Against which time they should have leasure to consider well of so waightie a busines, And a verie large and generall Somions might be given to all men to appeare then with perticuler intimation of the busines to be Determined to the intent that they might be the rather induced to affoord their presence which if they did not they should be without excuse for ever after complayninge.",

Hee likewise made known how much Sr. Frances Wyat was commended for [387] his good service and noble Carriage of himselfe in his Government.

    "1263": "[Refer ks Note] In 1906 the Library of Congress published, in two quarto volumes entitled \u201cThe Records of the Virginia Company of London,\u201d the text, from the manuscript in the Library, of the Court Book containing the minutes of that company\u2019s meetings, and of the meetings of its council, from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624, together with an elaborate and learned introduction by Miss Susan Myra Kingsbury, now professor of social economy in Bryn Mawr College, and a list prepared by her of additional documents illustrative of the company\u2019s history from the date of its chartering until after its dissolution by the Crown and the consequent conclusion of its business. These documents, 764 in number, are listed, with bibliographical references as to their sources, in the section of Miss Kingsbury\u2019s first volume (pp. 119-205) entitled \u2018List of Records.\u201d The project of publication formed at the time when those volumes were issued contemplated the printing, in additional volumes, of the documents thus listed, or of all those among them that had any historical significance. Their texts are now to be presented, in two volumes numbered III, IV, of The Records of the Virginia Company of London. The texts have been prepared by Miss Kingsbury with great care and accuracy. The first 273 of the documents arranged for publication are presented in the present volume. A nearly equal number, completing the series, will be presented in Volume IV, now in the printer\u2019s hands. The two volumes will constitute an addition of great magnitude, and of the highest interest, to the materials for the early history of Virginia, and their preparation, distinctly a labor of love on the part of Miss Kingsbury, places all future students of that history under a heavy debt of gratitude to their accomplished editor. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress. Vv",
    "1264": "Preface\n\nThe documents contained in Volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia Company of London are original papers, official and other, of the company or relating to it. While the Court Book of the Virginia Company, published as Volumes I and II of this series, presents minutes of the meetings of the corporation, the succeeding volumes contain materials that vivify its decisions and decrees, explain the difficulties met and overcome by that redoubtable group of adventurers, reveal the petty jealousies of the administrators, and especially record the controversy between the company and the Crown that resulted in the dissolution of the corporation and the creation of the first crown colony of Great Britain.\n\nFour official sets of records are herein printed or cited. Two are published in full. One set is the original papers contained in the volume, now preserved in the Library of Congress, which has long been referred to as \u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III.\u201d One set embodies records of action in law courts by the company or against the company. They are taken from the records of the various British courts and were found in the Public Record Office. Two sets are not here included as originally planned. They have been published in full since this series was begun. One is the \u201cCourte Booke\u201d of the colony, February 4, 1622/23, through February 9, 1632/33. It is now printed under the title \u201cMinutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia,\u201d edited by Dr. H. L. McIlwaine (Richmond, Va., 1924). The other set of documents has been published in the \u2018Acts of the Privy Council, Colonial\u201d, volume I (London, 1908). Some actions of the council that concerned the Virginia Company of London are not to be found in that publication. They are therefore here printed. The collection called the Sackville Papers, discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I, page 114, was, by the courtesy of the third Lord Sackville, examined by Prof. A. Percival Newton, of the University of London, and the documents relating to Virginia were printed in 1922 in the American Historical Review, Volume XXVII, pages 493 to 538 and 738 to 765. Those bearing dates earlier than 1623 are not here reprinted.\n\nIncluded in this volume are manuscripts from two collections that are unique. The \u201cSmyth of Nibley\u201d papers give the history of a single settlement, called Smyth\u2019s (or Smith\u2019s) Hundred, that is typical of the various hundreds of the colony. They extend from February 3, 1618/19, to August 1, 1622, inclusive. These papers are all in the New York Public Library. The \u201cFerrar Papers,\u201d on the other hand, now belonging to Magdalene College, Cambridge University, are a veritable gold mine; their unique value is discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I. They supply a vast amount of information through the correspondence between the colony and individual planters of the colony and Sir Edwin Sandys, Nicholas Ferrar, and John Ferrar, and also between Sir Edwin Sandys and the other officials of the company. Only a few documents are official, including two reports from the council in Virginia, a record of a Somers Islands court, and some less important items of this type. The first paper bears the date June 8, 1617, and the last November 1, 1624. But only a few go beyond midsummer of 1622. VI",
    "1265": "vii PREFACE On the other hand, the \u2018\u2018Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III,\u201d do not begin until August 12, 1621, but continue throughout the life of the company. They differ in character from the Smyth of Nibley Papers and the Ferrar Papers. As stated above, they record official acts of the council in Virginia and include commissions, proclamations, orders, laws, letters to and from the council in London, and petitions to the governor and council in Virginia. Communications between the company and the King or the privy council, and some letters to and from the governor and council of the colony, were spread on the minutes of the company, and therefore appear in Volumes I and II, of this series. They are not reproduced in Volumes III and IV, even though the original documents are found in the other collections. All documents here published are discussed at length in the Introduction to Volumes I and II of this series. Practically every paper indicated as to be included in the series by the star affixed in the \u2018List of Records\u201d that appears in the Introduction to Volume I is here printed. Two documents (List of Records No. 70 and No. 153) could not be found, and it has proved impossible to secure a copy of No. 12. Fifty-seven documents dating earlier than April 28, 1619, when the records in Volume I begin, are printed in this volume. They include all records that had not heretofore been known or published by Alexander Brown, the Virginia Magazine of History, or other reliable works on the early history of Virginia. Perhaps the most important documents found by the editor that are here included are the \u201cInstructions Orders and Constitutions to Sr Thomas Gates knight Governor of Virginia\u201d of May, 1609, and the \u2018Instructions orders and constitutions ... to... Sr Thomas West knight Lo: La Warr,\u201d 1609/10, by the Virginia Council. These are the first instructions given by the competent authority to a British colony. Source material for the history of the company through the year 1622 is presented in this volume. March 22, 1622, saw the frightful massacre of colonists by the Indians. The story of that tragedy, the efforts for recovery, and the beginning of the reestablished colony conclude this volume. The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, chief of the division of manuscripts in the Library of Congress, for his painstaking care in reading the proof to the original documents of the \u2018\u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III,\u201d and to some of the photostats of material in England, and also for his constant watchfulness in seeing the documents through the press. To Marian Carter Anderson the editor is indebted for her valuable and expert assistance in preparing much of the manuscript, and especially in the difficult reading of practically all of the proof. Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index of Volume III, and to her the editor wishes to express gratitude for the complete and accurate contribution she has made to the usefulness of the documents in historical research. A part of the expense for reading the proof and the cost of preparing the index were met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council. June 30, 1932. Susan M. Kingsbury.",
