This being done, the Governor himselfe alledged that before we proceeded any further it behooved us to examine whither it were fitt, that Captaine Martin\u2019s Burgesses shoulde have any place in the Assembly, forasmuche as he hath a clause in his Patente which doth not onely exempte him from that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders which the great charter saith are to extende over the whole Colony, but also from diverse such lawes as we must be enforced to make in the General Assembly. That clause is as followeth: Item. That it shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Captain John Martin, his heyers, executours and assignes to governe and comaunde all suche person or persons as at this time he shall carry over with him, or that shalbe sente him hereafter, free from any comaunde of the Colony, excepte it be in ayding and assisting the same against any forren or domestical enemy. Upon the motion of the Governor, discussed the same time in the assembly, ensued this order following:\n\nAn order of the General Assembly touching a clause in Captain Martin\u2019s Patent at James Citty, July 30, 1619.\n\nAfter all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted into the house and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain Martin\u2019s Patent was produced by the Governor out of a Clause whereof it appeared that when the general assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for the whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole company and chuse whether they would obay the same or no, It was therefore ordered in Courte that the foresaid two Burgesses should withdraw themselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had made his personall appearance before them. At what time, if upon their motion, if he would be contente to quitte and give over that parte of his Patente,",
    "1436": "JULY 30, 31, AUGUST 2, 3, 4, 1619\n\n157 and contrary thereunto would submit himselfe to the general forme of governement as all others did, that then his Burgesses should be readmitted, otherwise they were to be utterly excluded as being spies rather than loyal Burgesses, because they had offered themselves to be assistant at the making of lawes which both themselves and those whom they represented might chuse whether they would obaye or not. Then came there in a complainte against Captain Martin, that having sent his Shallop to trade for corne into the baye, under the commaunde of one Ensigne Harrison, the saide Ensigne should affirme to one Thomas Davis, of Paspaheighe, Gent. (as the said Thomas Davis deposed upon oathe,) that they had made a harde voiage, had they not mett with a Canoa coming out of a creeke where their shallop could not goe. For the Indians refusing to sell their Corne, those of the shallop entered the Canoa with their armes and tooke it by force, measuring out the corne with a baskett they had into the Shallop and (as the said Ensigne Harrison saith) giving them satisfaction in copper beades and other trucking stuffe. Hitherto Mr. Davys upon his oath. Furthermore it was signified from Opochancano to the Governour that those people had complained to him to procure them justice. For which considerations and because suche outrages as this might breede danger and loss of life to others of the Colony which should have leave to trade in the baye hereafter, and for prevention of the like violences against the Indians in time to come, this order following was agreed on by the general assembly: A second order against Captain Martin, at James Citty, July 30, 1619. It was also ordered by the Assembly the same day in case Captaine Martin and the gang of his shallop would not thoroughly answere an accusation of an outrage committed against a certaine Canoa of Indians in the baye, that then it was thought reason (his Patent notwithstanding, the authority whereof he had in that case abused) he should from henceforth take leave of the Governour as other men, and should putt in security, that his people shall committe no such outrage any more. 1282--3. 12",

At the reading of this the Assembly thought good to send for Mr. Abraham Persey, the Cape marchant, to publishe this instruction to him, and to demaunde of him if he knewe of any impediment why it might not be admitted of? His answere was that he had not as yet received any such order from the Adventurers of the in England. And notwithstanding he sawe the authority was good, yet was he unwilling to yield, till such time as the Governor and Assembly had layd their commandment upon him, out of the authority of the foresaid Instructions as followeth:\n\nBy the General Assembly.\n\nWe will and require you, Mr. Abraham Persey, Cape Marchant, from this daye forwarde to take notice, that, according to an article in the Instructions confirmed by the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in Englande at a general quarter courte, both by voices and under their hands and the Comon seall, and given to Sir George Yeardley, knight, this present governour, Decemb. 3, 1618, that you are bounde to accepte of the Tobacco of the Colony, either for commodities or upon billes, at three shillings the beste and the second sorte at 18d the pounde, and this shalbe your sufficient dischardge.\n\nJames citty out of the said General Assembly, July 31, 1619.\n\nAt the same the Instructions convertible into lawes were referred to the consideration of the above named Committies, viz., the general Instructions to the first Committie and the particular Instructions to the second, to be returned by them into the assembly on Munday morning.\n\nSunday, Aug. 1.

In fine, being demanded out of the former order whether he would quitte that clause of his Patent which (quite otherwise than Sir William Throckmorton's, Captain Christopher Lawnes and other men's patentes) exempteth himselfe and his people from all services of the Colonie except only in case of warre against a forren or domesticall enemie, His answere was negative, that he would not infringe any parte of his Patente. Whereupon it was resolved by the Assembly that his Burgesses should have no admittance. To the second order his answere was affirmative, namely, that (his Patent notwithstanding) whensoever he should send in to the baye to trade, he would be contente to putt in security to the Governour for the good behaviour of his people towards the Indians. It was at the same time further ordered by the Assembly that the Speaker, in their names, should (as he nowe doth) humbly demaunde of the Treasurer, Counsell and Company an exposition of this one clause in Captaine Martin's Patente namely, where it is saide That he is to enjoye his landes in as large and ample manner, to all intentes and purposes, as any lord of any manours in England dothe holde his grounde out of which some have collected that he might by the same graunte protecte men from paying their debts and from diverse other dangers of lawe.

    "1443": "164 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nUpon the same ground and reason their lo\u1d56\u02e2, together with the rest of the Counsell and Company, are humbly besought by this general assembly that if in that other clause which exempteth the Captaine Martin and his people from all services of the Colony etc., they shall finde any resistance [to] that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders intended nowe by them to be established over the whole Colony, that they would be pleased to reforme it. In fine, wheras Captaine Martin, for those ten shares allowed him for his personal adventure and for his adventure of \u00a370 besides, doth claim 500 acres a share, that the Treasurer, Counsell and Company would vouchsafe to give notice to the Governour here, what kinde of shares they meante he should have when they gave him his Patent.

As touching the instruction of drawing some of the better disposed of the Indians to converse with our people and to live and labour amongst them, the Assembly who know well their dispositions think it fit to enjoin, least to counsel those of the Colony, neither utterly to reject them nor yet to draw them to come in. But in case they will of themselves come voluntarily to places well peopled, there to do service in killing of Deer, fishing, beating of Corn and other works, that then five or six may be admitted into every such place, and no more, and that with the consent of the Governor.

All these lawes being thus concluded and consented to as aforesaid Captaine Henry Spellman was called to the barre to answere to certaine misdemeanors layde to his chardge by Robert Poole, interpretour, upon his oath (whose examination the Governor sent into England in the Prosperus), of which accusations of Poole some he acknowledged for true, but the greatest part he denyed. Whereupon the General Assembly having throughly heard and considered his speaches, did constitute this order following against him:\n\nAug. 4th, 1619. This day Captaine Henry Spelman was convented before the General Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole, Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman and Opochaneano at Poole\u2019s meeting with him in Opochancano\u2019s court. Poole chardgeth him he spake very unreverently and maliciously against this present Governor, whereby the honour and dignity of his place and person, and so of the whole Colonie, might be brought into contempt, by which means what mischiefs might ensue from the Indians by disturbance of the peace or otherwise, may easily be conjectured. Some things of this relation Spelman confessed, but the most part he denyed, except only one matter of importance, and that was that he had informed...",

By which and by other reports it seemeth he hath alienated the minde of Opochancano from this present Governour, and brought him in much disesteem, both with Opochancano and the Indians, and the whole Colony in danger of their slippery designes. The general assembly upon Poole\u2019s testimony only not willing to putt Spelman to the rigour and extremity of the lawe which might, perhaps both speedily and deservedly, have taken his life from him (upon the witness of one whom he much excepted against) were pleased, for the present, to censure him rather out of that his confession above written than out of any other proofe. Several and sharpe punishments were pronounced against him by diverse of the Assembly, But in fine the whole court by voices united did encline to the most favorable, which was that for this misdemeanour he should first be degraded of his title of Captaine, at the head of the troupe, and should be condemned to performe seven years service to the Colony in the nature of Interpreter to the Governour. This sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more of the Savage than of the Christian, muttered certaine wordes to himselfe neither shewing any remorse for his offenses, nor yet any thankfulness to the Assembly for their so favourable censure, which he at one time or another (God\u2019s grace not wholly abandoning him) might with some one service have been able to have redeemed. This day also did the Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Argall\u2019s towne, present a petition to the general assembly to give them an absolute discharge from certain bondes wherein they stand bound to Captain Samuell Argall for the payment of 600' and to Captain William Powell, at Captaine Argall\u2019s appointment, for the payment of 50' more. To Captaine Argall for 15 skore acres of wooddy ground, called by the name of Argal\u2019s towne or Paspaheigh; to Captaine Powell in respect of his paines in clearing the grounde and building the houses, for which Captaine Argal ought to have given him satisfaction. Nowe, the general assembly being doubtful whether they have any power and authority to discharge the said bondes, doe by these presents (at the Instance of the said Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Martin\u2019s hundred people) become most humble sutours to",
    "1455": "176 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nthe Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England that they wilbe pleased to gett the said bondes for 600 li to be cancelled; forasmuche as in their great comission they have expressly and by name appointed that place of Paspaheigh for parte of the Governour\u2019s lande. And whereas Captain William Powell is payde his 50 li which Captain Argall enjoined the saide Inhabitantes to presente him with, as parte of the bargaine, the general assembly, at their intreaty, do become sutours on their behalfe, that Captaine Argall, by the Counsell and Company in England, may be compelled either to restore the said 50 li from thence, or else that restitution thereof be made here out of the goods of the said Captaine Argall.\n\nThe last acte of the Generall Assembly was a contribution to gratifie their officers, as followeth: Aug. 4th, 1619.\n\nIt is fully agreed at this general Assembly that in regard of the great paines and labour of the Speaker of this Assembly (who not onely first formed the same Assembly and to their great ease and expedition reduced all matters to be treatted of into a ready method, but also his indisposition notwithstanding wrote or dictated all orders and other expedients and is yet to write severall bookes for all the Generall Incorporations and plantations both of the great charter, and of all the lawes) and likewise in respecte of the diligence of the Clerke and sergeant, officers thereto belonging, That every man and manservant of above 16 yeares of age shall pay into the handes and Custody of the Burgesses of every Incorporation and plantation one pound of the best Tobacco, to be distributed to the Speaker and likewise to the Clerke and sergeant of the Assembly, according to their degrees and rankes, the whole bulke whereof to be delivered into the Speaker\u2019s handes, to be divided accordingly. And in regarde the Provost Marshall of James citty hath also given some attendance upon the said General Assembly, he is also to have a share out of the same. And this is to begin to be gathered the 24th of February nexte.\n\nIn conclusion, the whole Assembly comaunded the Speaker (as nowe he doth) to present their humble excuse to the Treasurer Counsell and Company in England for being constrained by the intemperature of the weather and the falling sick of diverse of the Burgesses to breake up so abruptly\u2014before they had so much as putt their lawes to the ingrossing.",
    "1456": "JULY 30, 31, AUGUST 1, 2, 3, 4, 1619\n\nThis they wholly comitted to the fidelity of their speaker, who therein (his conscience telles him) hath done the parte of an honest man, otherwise he would be easily founde out by the Burgesses themselves, who with all expedition are to have so many bookes of the same lawes as there be both Incorporations and Plantations in the Colony. In the seconde place, the Assembly doth most humbly crave pardon that in so shorte a space they could bring their matter to no more perfection, being for the present enforced to sende home titles rather than lawes, Propositions rather than resolutions, Attemptes than Acchievements, hoping their courtesy will accepte our poor endevour, and their wisedome wilbe ready to supporte the weakness of this little flocke. Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech the said Treasurer, Counsell and Company, that albeit it belongeth to them onely to allowe or to abrogate any lawes which we shall here make, and that it is their right so to doe, yet that it would please them not to take it in ill parte if these lawes which we have now brought to light, do passe currant and be of force till suche time as we may knowe their farther pleasure out of Englande: for otherwise this people (who nowe at length have gotten the raines of former servitude into their owne swindge) would in shorte time growe so insolent, as they would shake off all government, and there would be no living among them. Their last humble suite is, that the said Counsell and Company would be pleased, so soon as they shall finde it convenient, to make good their promise sett downe at the conclusion of their commission for establishing the Counsel of Estate and the General Assembly, namely, that they will give us power to allowe or disallowe of their orders of Courte, as his Majesty hath given them power to allowe or to reject our lawes. In sume Sir George Yeardley, the Governour prorogued the said General Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to fall out this present yeare of 1619, and in the mean season dissolved the same.",

But at my coming to Northborn on Wednesday the 11th of this present, I found the Ship gone the day before. I found also some letters to me out of the Ship: which gave me no great content, conceiving they wanted some of our number appointed, & yet were unwilling to take any more in. And as for Nicolas Tufton, they sent not to him at all. But perceiving by my men, that after the writing of those letters, that had taken in those five which we sent to them in the Sandwich boat; & other two which my folk had here provided; & hearing also that they had got a good pilot out of the Kings Ships, (for at Sandwich they could get none); & that at their setting of Sail, which was on Tuesday at noon, they wanted but one of their complete number of six score: I must confess I was then not a little comforted: but much more, & more again every day since, the wind having continued here so constantly prosperous. I hope verily by this they are on a quarter of their way. What had they been, if they had not lost those two days at the custom House? I trust the blessing of God is with us in this Action: & then will we not fear what the Devil can work against it. I disbursed Ten shillings amongst those seven: which with",

I am also put in some hope & expectance, that my Lord of Doncaster will be pleased to take my house in his way: at which time I should be exceedingly loth to be absent, being so much beholden to his Lordship as I am. Meantime I am, & have been careful, that there should be no neglect found in our Virginia business. The chief whereof is now, the paying of mariners' wages, & freight of Ships returned: which is all well performed by my honest, faithful & careful Deputy; whom I have furnished for that purpose with above One Thousand pounds & upward; so that all men have been satisfied justly at their days. Only one thing doth much perplex me, wherein I shall be bold to crave some Direction from your Lordship. The Governor Sr George Yeardley, having taken exceeding pains for the settling of all matters in order in Virginia, & for laying the foundation of a regular State, according to his Instructions & other Directions; hath suddenly fallen into a violent resolution of quitting his Place, (grounding himself upon an error,) & ceaseth not by all his letters public & private to importune it. The error is, that he conceiveth Sr Thomas Smyth still to be Treasurer, with his Alderman Deputy: & supposeth that he shall be there.",

Smyth was highly offended with his (Sir George Yeardley's being) knighted: aleging that (it) being doon contrarie to his pleasure, yet both his name; & the whole companies name, were used in it (either) whereof [in truth] was so. Before Sr. Georges Departure, I both labored & effected a Reconciliation, (thinking it very unfitt that the Treasurer of the Companie, & the Governor of the Colonie, should be at Variance: & mutual offices of love (& frendship) & adres did passt on bothe sides. After Sr. Georges (was gone) departure; I (perceived) my woork to be unsound. For upon occasion of a motion made openly against Sr. G. Yeardley by a noble person in favor as (contemplation as seemed) was conceived of Captain Argall, Sr. Thomas taking the advantage renewed his former [24] displeasure; not long after upbraiding again in open court his unduely procured Knighthood: Mr. Canning also muttering matter of disgrace by (to) his wife: & this against a man, to whom they (had) professed frendship, (who was) chosen by themselves, & sent (by them in great part at his own private charges) to so difficult a service. The report hereof coming (as dooth now appeare) to Sr. G. Yeardley, (for his owne brother was present), hath bred in him this discontent, & hastie resolution, not to serve under his controll, whose hatred (though causeles) was so strong, as to break thorough the (nue) bounds of a publick reconciliation. Yet he offereth, that being dismissed of the place of Governor, he will continue in that Contrie, & prosecute with all care of Smiths Hundred busines. Which in particular for our Societie were a matter of much benefit: but the well carrying of the publick is of more importance. To the setting up whereof, we have this yeare alredy sent three Fifties of persons: One in Januarie with Sr. G. Yeardley, for the Governor's land: & the other two now lately, for the College & Companies lands. There were also in March last 20. sent for the Companies land in Captain Lawns Ship: & 4. in the Triall: & about 10. more for the publick will be recovered in the Contrie. My Desire is to make those Fifties up so manie Hundreds, to be sent away in the end of Januarie next. To which purpose I cast about for supplie of monie: & am in good hope to bring it to effect.

The occasion of this ships coming hither was an accidental consortship in the West Indies with the Treasurer an English man of warre also, licensed by a Commission from the Duke of Sauoye to take Spaniards as lawfull prize. This ship the Treasurer wente out of England in Aprill was tweluemoneth, about a moneth, I thinke, before any peace was concluded between the king of Spaine & that prince. Hither shee came to Captaine Argall then governour of this Colony, being parte-owner of her.

But our Governour being a soldier truly bred in that university of warre the lowe Countries, purposeth at a place or two upon the river fortifiable to provide for them, animating in the meane while this warlike people (than whom for their small number, no prince can be served wth better) by his example to prepare their courages. Both those of our nation and the Indians also have this Torride sommer bene visited wth great sicknes & mortality; wch our good God (his name be blessed for it) hath recompensed wth a maruelous plenty, such as hath not bene seen since our first coming into the land. For my selfe I was partly at land & partly at sea vexed wth a Calenture of some 4. or 5. months. But (praised be God) I am nowe as healthfull as ever I was in my life. Here (as yo lo? cannot be ignorant) I am, for fault of a better, Secretary of Estate, the first that ever was chosen and appointed by Commission from the Counsell and Company in England, under their handes & common seale. By my fees I must maintain my selfe; wch the Governour tells me, may this yeare amount to a matter of 300\u00a3 sterling; whereof fifty I doe owe to himselfe, and I pray God the remainder may amount to a hundred more. As yet I have gotten nothing, save only (if I may speak it wout boasting) a general reputation of integrity, for having spoken freely to all matters, according to my conscience; and as near as I could discern, done every man right.\n\nAs touching the quality of this country, three things there be, wch in few years may bring this Colony to perfection; the English plough, Vineyards, & Cattle. For the first, there be many grounds here cleared by the Indians to our handes, wch being much worn out, will bear no more of their corn, wch requireth an extraordinary deal of sap & substance to nourish it: but of our grain of all sorts it will bear great abundance. We have had this year a plentiful crop of English wheat, tho the last harvest 1618. was only shed upon the stubble, and so self-sown, wout any other manurance. In July last so soon as we had reaped this self-sown wheat, we set Indian corn upon the same ground, wch is come up in great abundance; and so by this means we are to enjoy two crops in one year from off one & the same field.

Vines here are in suche abundance, as wheresoeuer a man treads, they are ready to embrace his foote. I haue tasted here of a great black grape as big as a Damascin, that hath a true Muscatell-taste; the vine wherof now spending itselfe euen to the topps of high trees, if it were reduced into a vineyard, and there domesticated, would yeild incomparable fruite. The like or a better taste haue I founde in a lesser sorte of black grapes. White grapes also of great excellency I haue hearde to be in the country; but they are very rare, nor did I euer see or taste of them. For cattle, they do mightily increase here, both kine, hogges, & goates, and are much greater in stature, then the race of them first brought out of England. No lesse are our horses and mares likely to multiply, wch proove of a delicate shape, & of as good spirite & metall. All our riches for the present doe consiste in Tobacco, wherein one man by his owne labour hath in one yeare, raised to himselfe to the value of 200 li sterling; and another by the meanes of sixe seruants hath cleared at one crop a thousand pound english. These be true, yet indeed rare examples, yet possible to be done by others. Our principall wealth (I should haue said) consisteth in seruants: but they are chardgeable to be furnished wth armes, apparell, & bedding, and for their transportation, and casuall both at sea, & for their first yeare commonly at lande also: but if they escape, they prooue very hardy, and sound able men.

For all wch I return you threefold thankes & affection: wch shalbe redie to expresse it self really on your service, upon all fit occasions. I pray you not to faile to keep your Court on wendsday. You may please (if you see the Companie fit & in tune) to acquaint them that I am not idle in their busines, wch at the Court my self will make knowne unto them. If you fynd anie crosse proceedings, make a motion to have them referred to the quarter Court approaching. Let them knowe there are no generall letters to the Company come to my hands. Those to the Counseil I have a good while since caused to be presented to them: but they contein no matters of speedie consultation. That wch dooth concern the Companie, shalbe brought to them in fittyme. If wrong be offered, you may moove those of the Counceil wch are not factious, to goe from the Court, & your self goe with them, rather then the publick good or Justice should be oppressed by faction. But I hope there wilbe no such proceeding.",

For I will make bold (seeing it will be this day fortnight when I set out from here) to put into your hands my payment of 500 li to the East India Companie at their day, the 29th of this instant. And for the other 200 li will take the best order that in absence I can. For I am exceeding loath to fail of one hour of my due time: which I know will be marked. Therefore make also this addition to your kindness towards me: I mean your care of this payment. If the 2 you write of will go in person to Virginia, for my part I shall be ready to further it: providing fit conditions for our friend who is there. But hereof more fully at the meeting.

    "1521": "242 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nThese principall men being at James Citie, Capt. William Epps (who commandeth Smythes Hundred Company) was arraigned (as neere as might be) according to the laudable Lawes of England, for killing one Captaine Edward Roecroft als Stallenge. He came hither from the North Colony in a shipp of Sr. Ferdinando Gorges (as he sayd) for some necessaries which he wanted; and to coast along the shoare to fynd and discover what Harbors and rivers he could: but through neglect of the Master of the shipp and others she was forced aground in a storme neere Newports Newes, and there sprang so greate a leake, that he could not carry her back againe. This mischance happened through uncivill and unmanly words urged by Stallenge (there being no precedent malice) with which Captaine Epps being much moved did strike him on the heade with a sword in the scabbard with such an unfortunate blowe, that within 2. daies he died. The Jury (whereof Capt. Lawne was foreman a discreete and understanding man) hearing the Evidence, found him guilty of Manslaughter by Chaunce meddley. The Governor finding him (though young) yet a proper civill gent, and of good hopes, not long after restored him to his Command.\n\nCaptaine Henry Spelman being accused by Robte Poole (one of the interpreters of the Indian language) of many crimes which might be prejudiciall to the State in generall, and to every mans safety in particular, received Censure at this generall Assembly. But the Governor hoping he might redeeme his fault being proceeding much of Childishe ignorance, pardoned the punishment [1] upon hope of amendment. In triall whereof he was employed as interpreter to Patawamack to trade for Corne.\n\nCaptaine Ward in his shipp went to Monahigon in the No: Colony in May, and returned the latter end of July, with fishe which he caught there. He brought but a smale quantitie, by reason he hadd but little salte. There were some Plymouth shipps where he harbored, who made greate store of fishe, which is farr larger then New-land-fishe.\n\nThe George was sent by the Cape Marchant (with the Governor's consent) to New-found-land to trade and buy fishe for the better relief of the Colony and to make triall of that passage. One other reason (as I take it) was, for that the Magazin was well stoored with goods, it was somewhat doubtfull, whether a shipp would be sent to carry home the cropp so sone as the George might upon her returne back. She departed hence about the 9 of July, and arrived here againe about the 10: of September. She",
    "1522": "JANUARY, 1619/20\n\n243\n\nmade her passage to Newfound-land in less then 3. weekes, and was at the banck amongst the french fishermen in 14. daies. She came back hither againe in 3. weekes, with bare wyndes, and brought so much fishe as will make a saving voyadge, which, beside the greate releif, giveth much content to the wholl Colony. The Sturgeon shipp and the Triall departed hence together about the fiue of July. Mr. Pountys hath taken greate paines in fishing, and toward Michellmas (the weather being somewhat temperate) made some good sturgeon. He hopeth by the spring to be better fitted, with Cellars and houses, and to do some good therein. The Cattle in the Triall came exceeding well, and gaue the Colony much ioy and greate incouragement. Both they horses and Mares wilbe very vendible here a long tyme, the Colony increasing with people as of late. About the latter end of August, a Dutch man of Warr of the burden of a 160 tunes arriued at Point-Comfort, the Comander's name Capt. Jope, his Pilott for the West Indies one Mr. Marmaduke an Englishman. They mett with the Treasurer in the West Indyes, and determyned to hold consort shipp hetherward, but in their passage lost one the other. He brought not any thing but 20. and odd Negroes, which the Governor and Cape Marchant bought for victuall (whereof he was in greate need as he intended) at the best and easyest rate they could. He hadd a lardge and ample Commission from his Excellency to range and to take purchase in the West Indyes. Three or 4. daies after the Treasurer arriued. At his arriuall he sent word presently to the Governor to know his pleasure, who wrote to him, and did request myselfe Leiftenante Peace and Mr. Ewens to goe downe to him, to desyre [23] him to come vp to James Cytie. But before we gott downe he hadd sett saile and was gone out of the Bay. The occasion hereof happened by the vnfrendly dealing of the Inhabitants of Keqnoughton, for he was in greate want of victualls, wherewith they would not releive him nor his Company vpon any termes. He reported (whilst he staied at Keqnoughton) that if wee gott not some Ordnance planted at Point Comfort, the Colony would be quyte vndone and that ere long: for that vndoubtedly...",

Amongst other frivolous messages he requested, that 2. shipps might be speedyly sent to Patawamack where they should trade for greate stoore of corne. Herevpon (according to his desyre) the Governor sent an Englishman with him by land, and in the begynning of October, Capt Warde's ship and Somer-Island frigate departed James City hether-ward. Robte Poole being wholly ymployed by the Governor of messages to the King, persuaded Sir George, that if he would send Pledges he would, he but Contagious. would come to visite him. Our Corne and Tobacco being in greate abundance in our grounds (for a more plentyfull yere then this, it hath not pleased God to send vs since the beginning of this Plantation, yet very contagious for syeknes, whereof many both old and new men died) the Governor sent two men vnto him, who were returned with frivolous aunsweres, saying he never hadd any intent to come vnto him. The Governor being iealous of them (the rather because wee hadd many straggling Plantations, much weakened by the greate mortality, Poole lykewise proving very dishonest) requested Captaine William Powell and myself (for Opachankano professeth much love to me, and giueth much credite to my worde) to goe in a shallopp unto Pomonkey ryver: which wee did.

Their intertaynement at the first was harshe, (Poole being even turned heathen) but after their message was delyuered, it was kindly taken, they sent away lovingly, and Poole accused and Condemned by them, as an instrument that sought all the meanes he could to breake our league. They seemed also to be very weary of him. Opachankano much wondered I would not goe to him, but (as I wished the messengers) they said I was syck of an ague, wherewith they were satisfied. Wee hadd no order to bring Poole away, nor to make any shew of discontent to him, for feare he should perswade them to some myscheif in our corne feilds, hoping to gett him away by fayre meanes. So wee returned in greate love and amyty to the greate content of the Colony, which before liued in dayly hazard, all messages being vntruly delyuered by Poole on both sides. The Chikahomynies come not at us, but wee receyue no domage by them. The Governor hath bounded the lymytts of the 4. Corporations the Companies, the Governor, the Vniversity and Glebe lands according to the Commission.

They came by the west Indyes, which passage at that season doth much refreshe the people.",
    "1525": "246 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nThe proportion of Victualle brought for those 100. men fell so short, that Captaine Welden and Mr. Whitaker were forced (notwithstanding our plenty) to putt out 50. or thereabouts for a yere, by the Governor and Councell's advise. For whom they are to receive the next yere, 3. barrells of corne and 55 lb of tobacco for a man; with their sicknes considered (for seldom any escapeth little or much) is more than they of themselves could ever gett.

He is fitting his smale vessell, and purposeth this Inland sea this spring to make a new tryall.\n\nCapt. Lawne at his arrivall seated himself in Wareskoyack Bay with his Company, but by his owne sicknes and his peoples (wherein there was no one the improvidency) he quytted his Plantation, went up to Charles City, and about November died. So his project is likely (unless better followed and well seconded) to come to nothing.\n\nSmythes Hundred people are seated at Dauncing Point, the most convenyent place within their lymitts.

Many who were industrious having reaped good crops, but most not of equal spirit and industrious have less, yet exceeded other New-Comers. Many of these have also died by sickness, but not comparable to other places. About the latter beginning of December Capt. Ward with his ship and the frigate came from Patawamack. Japasons had dealt falsely with them, for they could get little trade, so that they brought not above 800 bushels, and the most part whereof they took by force from Japasons Country who deceived them, and a small quantity they traded for. But in conclusion being very peaceable with all the other Indians, at their departure they also made a firm peace again with Japazons. At this time also came Captain Woodiff in a small ship of Bristow, who brought his people very well, and made his passage in ten weeks. Thus far as part of my duty (ever ready at your service) have I briefly made known unto you, some particulars of our estate: and withal in conclusion cannot choose but reveal unto you the sorrow I conceive, to hear of the many accusations heaped upon Captain Argall, with whom my reputation hath been unjustly jointed [44] but I am persuaded he will answer well for himself. Here have also been divers depositions taken and sent home by the Diana, I will tax no man therein: but when it shall come to further trial, I assure you that you shall find many dishonest and faithless men to Captain Argall, who have received much kindness at his hands & to his face will contradict, and be ashamed of much, which in his absence they have intimated against him. Lastly, I speak on my own experience for these 11 years, I never amongst so few, have seen so many false-hearted, envious and malicious people (yea amongst some who march in the better rank) nor shall you ever hear of any the justest Governor here, who shall live free, from their scandal and shameless exclamations, if way be given to their report.

The defect is (which makes me sigh) that my sufficiencies from hence (heu quantum est in rebus inane!) cannot in the thousand part answer yours every way so complete, out of England. And though I had it in my person, yet the place so newly inhabited wants many helps, wherewith those civiler parts do abound. Howbeit this year to come (for the last was full of infirmities in all kinds) so it please God to continue my health as it is, being never more perfect in any place wheresoever I have remained, I will rouse up my spirits to do all that may be possible. Neither shall the uncertainty of my being continued, or by some new governor thrust out of my place, any whit dismay me from performance of my duty for the Interim; for that is a stroke, though many times unjust and cruel, for which there is no sense. In this dispatch I have sent you enclosed in a letter of mine to the Counsel and Company, a copy of a warrant from the Governor and Counsel here, for establishing my fees, according as it was there ordered in court, before my coming away. Herein (as all of them can be my witnesses) I was not mine own carver at all; but they in [1] mine absence, and without my suggestion, did order mine allowance, as appeareth in the same copy. For the first whole year from the time my commission was delivered me, I received not a farthing, and since that, very little, being fain to trust the most of those I do service for. If the Company shall be pleased to confirm unto me that, which all men of reason here do think to be but reasonable, I shall esteem both my hazard and my pains well bestowed, although, do what I can, I fear me, that at my three years end I shall scarce make a saving voyage. In summa summarum, whatsoever they in their wisdom and bounty shall think fit to allot me I will rest contented.\n\nNow in answer to your letter by the same ship. Your love I do most thankfully acknowledge; and I think Sir George Yeardley will not deny, but he hath still cause to affect me every day more and more. To that noble Earl I am deeply bound, who cannot but testify on my behalf, that when he employed me in his own particular service I performed it fully to his mind, and above his expectation, and will hope to do the like, if ever I shall have the honour to serve him again. As it hath been your endeavour to maintain his lo' good favour toward Sir George Yeardley,",

It would grieue me, that any error or disaster should haue any power to worke any contrary effecte. But you knowe that humanii est errare, and disasters what wisedome can preuent? If his lo\u1d48 be offended in ought, it wilbe in respect of his more than ordinary affection towards Captain Argall, whose faultes Sir George was bounde by commission, and for the saluing of his owne reputation also, to discouer. Sir George Yeardley, I thinke, would not robb Captaine Argall of my lordes loue, for he hath in him to deserue muche; nor would he haue his lo\u1d48 to haue spent so muche loue upon any man in vaine; but onely doth wishe that Captain Argall being riche, a Bachelour, and deuoid of chardge, would not so excessively intende his owne thrifte. As touching Sir George his intercepting of my letters, his lo\u1d48 I knowe (so noble is he) will not be implacable. And on the other side, I knowe not howe he will interpret that w\u1d9c\u02b0 hath bene written concerning the Treasurer (w\u1d9c\u02b0 Argall called his ship, while she was here) or concerning Spelmans vnaduised using of his lo\u1d48 name to Opochancano. Meane while in the dangers wherein the Colony stood, Sir George thought himselfe vnworthy of a remedy, vnlesse he had sett dewne the truth of the case. What tempestes that answere of his by the Diana, and those other letters then and since haue raised in your court, I doe almost fear to think of. Without his comandement I did nothing [2] and that w\u1d9c\u02b0 I did, he viewed and reuiewed still to a syllable.

And whosoeuer do so, shall in my conceipte do far better, than those others (who they were, I knowe not) that by the Marigolde putt this gouernour for the time (whenas I serued him w\u1d9c\u02b0 the greatest fidelity and zeale that was possible) into so many violent needles Jelousies against me, which notwithstanding.",

This secret I would not putt into any hand but yours, nor into yours, but onely for that intent.

By the Bona noua I purpose to sende you copies of suche graunts of lande, as we shall haue passed to the ende, that if you like not the forme, you may be pleased to reforme it. If you receiued Sir George his dispatehe by the Prosperous I would beseech you to viewe the general petition against Captaine Argall of those nine of James citty, contained in one sheet and to compare the original wth the copie sent you nowe in Sir George his boxe, and if you finde neuer so little difference between them though but a worde that you would vouchsafe to giue me notice by the first, for it may concerne me. You may best doe it by correcting the said copie by the original, and sending it back againe. More time I will not presume to rob you of, that haue so many better wayes to employe it.

For bringing the King's picture as a messenger from Opochancanough, we counted him a publique, and as it were a neutral person, and so for not discontenting Opochancanough, with whom now we stand in terms of reconciliation, we thought it no ways convenient to call Poole to account.

Letter, Signed List of Records No. 158 Honorable Knight Once more give me leave to interrupt you in answering an objection which some may make against Sir George Yeardley for preferring to serve the Company in his place of his government, for his three years in case he be continued gratis. Against this some man may allege that he hath broke his proffer in taking this year a rent of Corn and tobacco, though not much, from Martins hundred people, whom Capt Argall had placed on the Governor's land. To this he answers, first that what he received from them did not arise out of the labors of those fifty of his guard, which the Company allowed him, by whose labor he hath not yet reaped a penny benefit, save only and merely in Corn, which he cannot convert into money, because he must reserve it for his next year's provision. Secondly he is at least 800 pounds sterling out of purse by reason of this chargeable employment and that if he should heal up his estate again out of the Governor's land, only to that suffice, and no farther, yet might he be said to serve them, gratis, having made but one of one. But still he professeth as in his former that he consecrateth that expense wholly to the service of the Colony, that he will not from henceforth raise a penny profit out of those men's labor that remain of his guard, or that shall be sent over for a farther addition, but apply it wholly to the building and maintaining a fort at Point Comfort: and lastly that he took that petty rent of Martins Hundred people, to make them acknowledge by the same act of theirs that Paspaheigh by express words in the great Commission did belong to the Governor and that they had been wrongfully seated by Capt Argall upon that land, with both he had instructions, and Sir George Yeardley Commission to lay out for the Governor's use.",

Besides he wisheth the generall Company would send greate store of Vignerons, and Vine plants of a good race though growinge in England, albeit they woulde doe better to be had of ffrance and Spaine. Mr Nicholas Leate the Marchant hath vpon my knowledge or (I am sure) had a lardge vine of Corynth grapes at the house he formerly dwelt in the garden whereof Containinge the same vine is parted but by a wall from the garden of the house where he nowe dwelleth.

The extreame Care, diligence, and labor spent about it, doth prepare our people for some more excellent subject. All those other Commodities can prosper in a wet yeare, when tobacco proves naught. Besides they are not in danger of frost, which sometimes overthrowes the greatest parte of the tobacco in the lande.

Copy of Opinion of Counsel upon the Patents of the Virginia Company\n\nMay, 1620\n\nManchester Papers, No. 271\n\nDocument in Public Record Office, London\n\nList of Records No. 170\n\nUpon Consideration of the patents & of the questions moved thereupon, I am of opinion as followeth.\n\n1. That Sr Thomas Smithe is not so absolutely made Treasurer by the 2nd patent as that he is not removable by the laws & orders of the company; either upon his own Desire to surrender the place; or upon other cause which they shall conceive to be reasonable; for although it may seem a hard exposition of the words (or other several occasions) that their wills shall be taken as an occasion to remove him; without expressing any just cause in certain yet when they have removed him by a general consent; it is not now to be questioned (as I Conceive) whether they had lawful cause or no; but their doings are to be holden lawful & just: & that by the intention of the 2nd patent without any help of the third; But when a Law (by authority of the 3rd patent is made) at a general court by Consent of the whole Company that all officers shall cease at such a time & new to be chosen; that is binding, & makes this point without question as I take it.\n\n2. That by the clause of the 3rd patent where the words are (we do give & grant to the said Treasurer & Company & their successors forever by these presents, that the said Treasurer & Company or the greater number of them so assembled (viz at the general quarter Court) shall & may have full power & authority to choose Councillors & officers & to make laws &c. That in this case the greater number of the Company without the Treasurer may make Laws &c: & that as well when there is no Treasurer at all, as when he is absent; for as I do conceive this great & general Quarter Court which is appointed by the 3rd patent only may be held without any Treasurer at all; and all things are to be dispatched there by the greater number of the company then assembled, & that by the express words of the patent; for although the",
    "1550": "268 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\ngraunt be to the sayd treasurer & Company for the doinge of theis thinges at this Court, yett that is but for forme onely, because all grauntes must be made to them by there name of Corporation & yt is not requisite that the treasurer should be privie or haue any voice in the makinge of theis Lawes; But for the holdinge of the petty Courts apointed by the patent, (& to be summoned by the treasurer) the treasurer must be one by expresse wordes, but so it is not here; Neither hath the treasurer any negative voice in the makinge of theis Lawes, nor can hinder the doinge of any thinge wch the greater nomber of the Company at this generall Court will do; and therefore in reason his presence is not needfull, the rather seinge he is not appointed by the patent to be present, as he is at the other Courte.\n\n3. I am of oppinion that the Company (without the treasurer) having power to make Lawes at the generall Court, haue also power to repeall & abrogate all or any former Lawes as yt seemes they haue done, for the Lawe of repeall is a Lawe as well as the former & eodem modo quo Constituitur Dissoluitur; And so the Lawes that were made for the degrees of establishing Lawes, & for election of officers by the balladinge boxe, though they were excellent & Comendable; yett being repealed by the same authority they were made, they are gone & determined.\n\n4. Sr. Edwin Sandes cannott be Continued treasurer by the act of the company vpon his former election, for that is against the Lawe of the company that all officers shall cease at the quarter courte Day in Easter terme yearely; but the Company may then choose him anewe, as yt is likely they did.\n\n5. I thinke that the Company here hath no power by the wordes of the 2 patent either to punishe or pardon offences comitted in Virginia especially in Capitall or criminall causes; 1 because they haue no power to proceed here against any such offence, as the gouernor there may do; & yf not to proceed against it then not to pardon yt; 2 although that graunt of the patent, be aswell to the treasurer & Company & there successors, as to the gouernor; yett the power is given to them accordinge to the natures & Limitts of there offices & places, respectiuely, that they shall & may within the precincts of Virginia or in the way by the seas thither &c: haue full power to Correct.",

And to the ease and increase of divers of those works, provision is now sent, for the erecting of Sawing-Mills, which may fill the whole Colony also with Planks and Boards, to their great ease and help in setting up their Buildings. The fifth, is SILK, for which that Country is exceeding proper, having innumerable store of Mulberry trees of the best.

    "1577": "JUNE 7, 1620\n\nI understand, by the late boastings of Sr Thomas Smith & his partizans, of their sedulous endeavours, by a cloud of untruths to make a fresh interposition between the most joyfull light of his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49s favour, & the darkness wherewith my self & my service rest yet obscured. An attempt of strange malignity: w\u1d9c\u02b0 if I have deserved by any offer of the least wrong to him or his, I will bear it w\u1d57\u02b0 patience; as the effect of just Revenge, though not measured by Justice. But if (being resolved by God's Grace to wrong no man) I have not so much as offended Sr Thomas Smith or his upholders, save only in one kind, in that I have not yielded to the abetting or cloaking of those courses in managing the affairs of Virginia, w\u1d9c\u02b0 w\u1d57\u02b0 derogation of his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49s authority, & contrary to his Royal Instructions (unworthily smothered), have been held from time to time, to the disheartening of all Adventurers, & perpetual keeping down of the Plantation that it might not prosper; & on the other side to the enriching of themselves or some of them, by means so unlawful as the endangering of the destruction & utter extirpation of the Colonie: And in that it hath pleased God also so to bless my late labours, that more hath been done in my one year, w\u1d57\u02b0 less than Eight Thousand pounds, for the advancement of that Colonie in People & store of Commodities, than was done in Sr Thomas Smith's Twelve years, w\u1d57\u02b0 expense of near Eighty Thousand pounds; as by view of both Accounts (if yet his be an Account,) doth manifestly appear: Then my good Lord, I humbly tender to his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49s Princely Justice, & to your Lordship's favorable mediation this equitable suit, that his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49 upon this complaint against me may be graciously pleased, to call me to my answer, before any indifferent Judges to be deputed by his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49. And if Sr Thomas Smith or his abettors be able to make good any one of their material accusations against me; or if his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49 should please also so to appoint, (though it be far from my disposition to be an Accuser of any man,) that I be required to make good what I have here informed to your Lordship, & I fail in any one material clause thereof: I shall willingly submit myself to condign censures for both, & from thenceforth make utter forfeit of all hope of his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49s favour, being that w\u1d9c\u02b0 of all worldly things I most earnestly desire. It was the saying of a wise man, that One good man doth never hate another. Seeing therefore this extreme hatred of me by Sr Thomas Smith, doth argue a great defect of Goodness in the one: let trial I beseech discover the party.",

But if his Majesty's pleasure shall be otherwise, & so as to suspend me from this service: upon the least intimation thereof from your Lordship, I shall of my own accord so withdraw my self from the Action, as no way to be occasion of hindering the choice of any other, whom his Majesty shall be pleased to appoint or commend: being wholly resolved for no worldly respect whatsoever, either actively or passively, so much as lieth in my power, to be any matter henceforward of the least offence to his Majesty, trusting also that by this my willing obedience & duty, his Majesty's gracious heart may be one day moved, to restore unto me the light & comfort of his Princely favor, which with all loyal humility I shall evermore seek & sue for.

Indian-corne also of my own I feed them with whereof I thank the Lord and praised be his name, there is enough in the Country for all the people now arrived: their allowance I give them exceedeth the proportion thought of in England, because helps of flesh and fish with such great abundance cannot readily be had therefore I allow them the more of these provisions. And had they arrived at a seasonable time of the year I would not have doubted of their lives and healths, but this season is most unfit for people to arrive here, and to tell you the very truth I doubt of much sickness for many of them to the number of 100 at least came some very weak and sick some crazy and tainted ashore, and now this great heat of weather striketh many more but for life I hope well, yet the Company must be content to have little service done by new men the first year till they be seasoned. The chief men for the Iron work being dead at sea and upon their present landing will give a great blow to the staggering of that business little or nothing will be done therein this summer it being a hot and heavy work, if this summer with all the means I have to help them I can but build lodgings and transport their materials I shall think I have done well. Your boatwright died soon after his landing at James City whereby I have no means so speedily to set up the new shallop for transporting the people and their provisions that had I not a shallop of my own to employ that way I know not what to do, I protest before God I run myself out of all the provision of corn I have for the feeding of these people looking for no recompense, the provision now sent being but one thousand and eighteen bushels of meal, which at a bushel per month being the least I can give them, will but serve them for ten weeks whereas Mr. Farrar saith he hath sent 6 months provision, Mr. Farrar is my worthy and loving friend but herein I must blame him in casting up so short allowance also for clothes they come very short wheresoever the fault is I know not it behoves him to look to it the people are ready to mutiny.",

    "1583": "JUNE 12, 1620\n\nJonathan came to an Anchor in this port the seven and twentieth of May, and set sayle from hence, the London Marchant the 7 of June, and the Jonathan the 9. The Duty arryved here the 25th of May, and departed yesterday being the Eleventh of June. By the three former ships, and in answer to the tres of the Counsell and of Smyths hundred society both the Governor and Counsell ioyntly, and the Governor also aparte have wrytten. This in their absence I thought expedyent to adde by the Duty nowe bound to trade and fish in Canada, where wee hope they will finde some men of Plymouth, to the ende that as you had wrytten by every one, so wee might imitate your example. The thinge which I will nowe propound to your Consideration are first. The season of the yeare which for mens health may be fyttest to arryve in this ameres Country. Wee here are in our opinions absolutely for the leafefall and the arrive in Virginia winter havinge found the springe and sommer both fatall and vnproffitable to newe Comers, and those other two seasons quyte Contrary, for instance, in these three last mentioned ships the people this springe Came in sickly, and too [too] late eyther by plantinge, settinge, howinge, clearinge ground, or buyldinge, to doe any worke of ymportance. The second thinge considerable is the election of your people; that as near as may be none but sound persons be sent hither, and those if it be possible tradesmen, husbandmen, and true labourers. The inconvenyence of vnsound bodyes amonge sound and healthfull, and of arryvinge in the springe, wee found in our voyadge by the Dyana both at sea, and after wee come on shore. And of this the Jonathan may be a sad president, who lost twenty five of your land people at sea, besides Mr. Rand the Master, and three marriners, and some more of the passengers nowe dead on shore. A third matter of ymportance is the passage from England hither, vpon the speedynes whereof the health of our people, and many other Comodityes doe mainely depende. Such a passage wee hope Mr. Elford Pylot of the Swan hath found by the Course of the Sommer Islands, those other passages by the West Indyes, and by the North beinge the two extreames of that golden Medyum which I hope will by proffitable use verify the sayinge Medio tutissimus ibis. John Damyron notwithstandinge he made a kinde of a vowe vpon our untoward northerly passage in the Dyana that he would never stand the like Course for Virginia againe preferred nowe abedyence before sacrafice, and followed the companyes directions by the way of the north, and by longe.",
    "1584": "302 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nYet since the continuance at sea (besides other inconvenience) lost to the Colony the little benefit of those silkewormes which his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 had so graciously bestowed upon us. And I pray God that Bonaventure, the Tryall and the Falcon (of whom we can yet hear no news) be not fallen into the same inconvenience out of the same directions. And if we may without offence (as I humbly beseech we may) utter our minds, we wonder why any should so long experience much doubt upon a northern passage, which is never commodious but in the spring and toward summer, both seasons in respect of the health of newcomers, of the plenty of the country, and of profit to be raised are most improper. Mr. Elford by being blessed of God with a short passage arriving in May brought all his people in health, who having been here now almost a month, do all, God be praised, as yet hold up their heads, do work stoutly, and take very good liking to the country. But they were a party of sound, honest, and country laboring men.\n\nNow as concerning the building of guest-houses, this time of the year is most unfitting, in respect of the timber to be felled, which would now be full of sap in respect of the heat, and lastly in respect of the people's attending their corn, whereon depend the lives of us all. In winter some good will be done in that kind. To draw the old planters also to assist in the iron works will be very harsh and difficult, and I do verily know, and without flattery may confidently affirm, that the Governor if he were able would defray all these public affairs out of his own purse, and would not put the people to so much as an hour's work. He hath already by the George, and the Bona Nova (which I was much against) proffered his salary towards the building of a fort at Point Comfort. If the Company please they may apply that to the building of guest-houses, and other public uses, and to keep the old planters from loss and murmuring.\n\nIt is not long ago, since the Governor made those that watched here at James City to contribute some labor to a bridge, and to certain platforms to mount great ordnance upon, being both for the use and defense of the same City, and so of themselves; yet they repined as much as if all their goods had been taken from them.",
    "1585": "JUNE 12, 1620\n\nOf these Iron workes so much affected by the Company, neyther the Governor, nor wee of the Counsell have any skill at all and must therefore be slowe in delyvering our opinions. Onely wee thinke, that so heavy and so important a worke, beinge fitt to exercyse the most perfect, Comon weale, should have taken moe tyme of delibtation there in England. But especially some skillfull man should have perused the country for a whole yeare before, and should have bene sure of some abundant Iron mine and fyt places to worke it in, Notwithstandinge that heretofore there hath in many partes of this Country bene gathered some quantety of that mine from the superficies of the earth. For Pytch and tarre, true it is, that as some quantety hath heretofore bene made, so may there be some made hereafter, but some here that have lyved longe in Poland doe say, that the worth will no way cont'vaile the chardge, and one reason is, that whereas in Poland a principall country for that comodity, there be whole forrests of pytch trees and none else, and that for fower, and five hundred myles together in this parte of Virginia the same kinde of trees growe but * * * skatteringe here one and there one, and may indeed be employed to that use but with greate labor, and as greate losse. For tymber, and bourdes well may they serve for the use of the Colony, but in sendinge for the same expressly out of England, the fraight would cost double the price of the comodity. Silke is a marvellous hopefull comodity in this Country, here beinge as site. many mulbery trees as in Persia, or in any other parte of the world besides. Vynes Cannot but prosper admirably well in this Country, where in many places you can hardly walke the woods for their intanglement. And in most parte of the Country you shall see vines with a body as big as a mans leg, as tall, and upright as the mast of a ship, not touchinge the espoused tree any where but at the top. Besides though the ordinary grape be but a Crab, very small, with a thick skin, greate stones, and iuice harsh, and lytle, yet many sortes whereof I my selfe have tasted are to be found of the quite contrary qualityes, and that in much excellency. Here be also singular white grapes though rare to be founde, yet shall it goe hard but",
    "1586": "304 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nI will bringe Mr. Chanterton to the findinge of them. Sure I am I haue tasted some grapes here as good as in Greece or Italy: But Sir I must tell you by the way, that Mr. Chanterton smells too much of Roome (in the territory whereof he served the Colonnessi) as he attempts to worke myracles with his Crucyfixe, and to shewe as much Zeale in mayntaining his sensles religion as he doth professe it with blindnes. Whereof the Governor, vnles he perceive some danger, will take no notyce, till the man have discovered his skill to the Country, and then if he prove turbulent, he will do with him as he shall see cause, or as he shalbe Comaunded out of England. Meane while he may be come hither as a spy, which pointe [MARGINAL NOTE: A Spye] we doe beseech you throughly to consider of. He told me he was at Roome in October last, and is nowe got hither by May, and therfore if he be come vpon such an errand, he hath made greate speed. Out of the Country by mine advise he shall not goe in hast to tell tales.\n\nThe last Commodity spoken of in your Charter is salt; the workes whereof we doe much marvell, you would have restored to their former vse; whereas I will vndertake in one day to make as much salt by the heate of the sunne, after the manner vsed in France, Spaine, and Italy, as can be made in a yeare by that toylesome and erroneous way of boyling sea water into salt in kettles as our people at Smyths Iland have hitherto accustomed. And therefore when you ent into this worke, you must send men skillfull in salt pondes, such as you may easily procure from Rochell, and if you can have none there, yet will some be found at Lymington, and in many other places in England. And this indeed in a short tyme might prove a reall worke of greate sustenance to the Colony at home, as of gaine abroad, here Fish in Aboundance being such stulls of excellent good fish, as ought rather to be admyred of such as have not seene the same, then Credited. Whereas the company doe give their tennants fifty acres vpon Smyths Iland some there are that smyle at it here, sayinge there is no ground in all the whole Iland worth the manuringe. But over against it on the maine, which Sir Thomas Dale bought from the Indyans for the company, there is as good ground as any is in Virginia, and such a place to live in by the reporte of those that have bene there as (savinge the incomodity of Musquitos, with the ground beinge once cleared will vanish) the like is skarce to be found againe in the whole country. And for my partycular, I was never so enamoured of any place which I have not seene, nor shalbe satisfyed till I have seene it.",

Whereas you have sent two Germans skillful in mines, here is a friend of mine as skillful as themselves, and myself, though unskillful, who do purpose within few days to make trial of their skill, in certain places where we hope to find better Commodity, and of less labor than Iron mine, and yet will not go about to prejudice the Iron mine neither. And if we chance to send you over any trial, it shall be both in that quantity, and in that truth and certainty as there shall be no doubt to be made of it. Where I speak above in this letter in the person of more than myself, I beseech you pardon me, because there I speak not mine own but the common opinion. The coming hither of that virtuous gentleman Capt. Thorpe, was to us in many respects as of an Angel from heaven, neither did I ever see any face out of my native country, that did more joy me. He will much help to bear our burden, and will be able in many matters soundly to resolve you at home. I pray God send more like unto him. Two things might have much discouraged me from doing my duty. One is your not vouchsafing to answer, had it been but in three lines, my so many, and so confident letters, so that I know not whether I write now to a friend or to an enemy. The other was the imbecility of some of Sir George his friends, who not having courage enough to defend his letter by the Flemish man of war, laid all the whole envy upon me, as if Sir George had been so weak, as to have signed to anything ignorantly, or against his will or as if I had counterfeited his hand and seal. My comfort is that this wrong hath advanced me to so high a dignity as it is now in my power to pardon my betters. Now that I suppose I have wearied you, I grow weary myself, though I shall never be weary to pray from the Almighty all happiness upon you and yours, nor to continue Your most cordially devoted to your service\n\nJo: Pory.\n\nJames City January\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

London: Printed by Thomas Snodham 1620.\n\nBy his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia\n\nAfter the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Almighty God to suffer the great Enemy of all good Actions and his Instruments, to encounter and interrupt, to oppresse and keepe weake, this noble Action for the planting of Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It hauing pleased him now contrarily of his especiall great grace, so to blesse and prosper our late carefull endeuours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for supplying of the present defects, wherewith the Colony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a sodaine growne to double that height, strength, plenty, and prosperity, which it had in former times attained: We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our place, accordingly as it hath beene also ordered by a generall Court, to Summon as it were by a kinde of louing inuitement, the whole Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great expences and trauailes.\n\n1 See vol.

    "1590": "308 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nAnd first to remoue that vnworthy aspersion, wherewith ill disposed mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from thence, and by rumours here at home, sought vniustly to staine and blemish that Countrey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it necessary for the full satisfaction of all, to make it publikely known, that by diligent examination we haue assuredly found, those Letters and Rumours to haue been false and malicious; procured by practise, and suborned to euill purposes: and contrarily disaduowed by the testimony vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Colony; by whom we are ascertained, that the Countrey is rich, spacious and well watered; temperate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accustomed to it; abounding with all Gods naturall blessings: The Land replenished with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Deere, and other Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Riuers (whereof many are exceeding faire and nauigable,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts desireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great store and variety: In Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reserued by the prouidence of God, for such as shall apply themselues faithfully to his seruice, and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation. But touching those Commodities for which that Countrey is proper, and which haue beene lately set vp for the Aduenturors benefit: we referre you to a true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and generall Court, and hereunto annexed for your better information. By which and other approued informations brought vnto vs, We rest in great assurance, that this Countrey, as it is seated neere the midst of the world, betweene the extreamities of heate and cold; So it also participateth of the benefits of bothe, and is capable (being assisted with skill and industry) of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and Cordage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with ease and plenty. The Masts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, (being the materials of Linnen,) which now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iren, which hath so wasted our English Woods, that it selfe in short time must decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia, (where wasting of Woods is a benefit)",
    "1591": "JUNE 22, 1620\n\nfor all good conditions answerable to the best in the world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of France and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will be found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferiour. We omit here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dispersed vp and downe the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent Dyes: of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall seruice: of sweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: of Cotten-wooll, and Suger Canes: all which may there also be had in abundance, with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle and Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Grae of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength, and fertility. The Cattle which we haue transported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred) become much bigger of Body, then the breed from which they came: The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde two Fawnes at a birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd, being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of New-found-Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpose can defame.\n\nNow touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country, We haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue bin sent thither this last yeere, and are now presently in going, twelue hundred persons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue specified: and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those that were gone before. The men lately sent, haue bin most of them choise men, borne and bred vp to labour and industry. Out of Deuonshire, about an hundred men, brought vp to Husbandry. Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, about one hundred and ten; and out of Sussex, about forty; all framed to Iron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme. There haue beene also sundry persons of good quality, much commended for sufficiency, industry and honesty, prouided and sent to take charge and gouernment of those people. The care likewise that hath beene taken by directions, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce the",
    "1592": "310 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\npeople and affaires in Virginia into a regular course, hath bin such and so great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and fashion of an orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The people are all diuided [5] into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land due to him set out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publike Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernour there, for the College, and for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and for diuers other necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are setled in their Seates, being allotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance. The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is reduced within the limits prescribed by his Maiestie: and the laudable forme of Iustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue speedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly hath, partly is bound to haue in short time a sufficient Minister: for whom maintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value. Which orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused the Colony now at length to settle themselues in a firme resolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest-houses, for entertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp their Ploughes; to the planting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple Commodities furnished and commended from hence. In summe, they are now so full of alacritie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall Assembly, they haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the set[6]ling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires of the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice. Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authoritie and pleasure, there hath beene a collection made of all the branches of the same, dispersed in his Letters Patents, now three times renewed: as also out of other Instructions proceeding from his Maiestie. Out of both which, together with such other Orders as (authorized by his Maiestie)",
    "1593": "JUNE 22, 1620 still the Company themselues haue thought necessary to make, hath beene compiled a booke of standing Orders and Constitutions, approued by the generall consent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, haue their businesse carried regularly, industriously, and iustly, euery man knowing both his right and duty, to their generall great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas the Colony likewise haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of England proper for the vse of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important circumstances should necessarily require: a course is likewise taken for the effecting of this worke; yet so as to submit it first to his Majesties view and approbation; it being not fit that his Maiesties Subiects should be gouerned by any other Lawes, then such as receiue the influence of their life from him. And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular, by whose charges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maiesties especiall grace) this famous Plan[tation] hath not onely beene vndertaken, but through so many difficulties vpheld and continued: we should be very greatly iniurious to them, if we should not acquaint them with this seasonable time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto them. We therefore let them know, that in this last yeare now ended, there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen seuerall Patents for particular Plantations; and more are in hand to be passed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vnprobable that vpon each of these Patents, diuers hundreds of persons will soone Plant in Virginia: there haue beene already transported vpon the first, aboue three hundred men. These and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion of Land to them and their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery share of twelue pounds & ten shillings, vpon a first diuision; & as much more vpon a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery person, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their own charges they shall transport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of June 1625. if he continue there three yeeres, either at one or seuerall times, or die after he is shipped for that voyage: It standeth them vpon, who are not willing...",

And to the end that not onely the Adventurors now living, but the Heires also of the deceased, may take certaine notice of the severall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Adventures in mony are due and belonging to them: And likewise that posteritie may truely know, by whose charges this Plantation (next under his Maiestie) hath beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: We have here, according to an Order of Court, set downe in an Alphabeticall Table the names of all the Adventurors, with all their severall summes adventured. Wherein if by errour, or other mis-accident, there have wrong be done to any man; if within one twelve moneth after the date hereof, he give notice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors, he shall be set right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere unto us, then to doe right unto them, with all Justifiable curtesie, who have beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending so much to the propagating of the true service of Almighty God, to the adding of greatnesse and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nation in disburdening their multitude. 22. Junij. 1620. [MARGINAL NOTE: 15] A Declaration of the Supplies intended to be sent to Virginia, in this yeare 1620. By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia. 18. Julij 1620. Whereas the Right Honourable, Henry Earle of Southampton, with the advise and consent of the Counseil and Company for Virginia, hath resolved and concluded to employ all good meanes in this present yeare, 1620. not onely for the advancing of the Plantation in strength and multitude of good people, but also for the enriching thereof with store of cattell of divers sorts, and by setting up or encreasing such Staple Commodities, as being proper for that Countrey, may be also of most necessary use for this Realme, and redound in fine to the greatest benefit of both Adventurors and Planters, and lastly [MARGINAL NOTE: 16] for the establishing there of such good Government (originally derived from the Kings most excellent Maiestie, the first and chiefe Founder of this glorious worke) as whereby the people 1 Next follows, in the Library of Congress copy of the book, \u2018A Note of the Shipping,\u201d etc., printed in this volume as Document No. XLIX (List of Records No. 92).",

First therefore we haue thought fit, to make it publikely knowne, that besides the great store of particular Plantations now in prouiding, and like very shortly in large proportion to augment, the Company haue resolued in a late generall Court, by the blessing of God, to set out this yeere at the publike charge, and to send to Virginia, eight hundred choise persons, of the qualities ensuing: First, foure hundred, to be Tenants of the general land of the Company, to make vp the number of those Tenants ful 500. wherof 200. to be placed at Elizabeth Citie, with the Companies Deputie: 100. at Henrico, 100. at Charles Citie: And at Iames Citie there are a hundred and more already. Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to such Officers, &c. as the Court already hath, or shall shortly appoint: vz. 10. for the Deputy of the College, [17] 40. for the Companies Deputy: 20. for the Secretary: 10 more (besides 50. already sent) for the Ministers: and 20. for the Phisitian: their care for the ease and prosperity of the Colonie, being such and so great, as to cause them to endowe those Offices and places, (as they haue formerly done others,) with faire possessions, furnished with Tenants and other fit prouisions: that the people may haue the benefit by them, and yet be freed from the burden. Thirdly, one hundred yong Maides to make wiues for these Tenants as the former 90. which haue been lately sent. Fourthly, one hundred Boyes, to be apprentizes likewise to the publike Tenants. Fiftly, one hundred seruants to be disposed amongst the old Planters, which they greatly desire, and haue offered to defray their charges with very great thankes. And although by reason of the preparations already made, the difficulty may be well conceiued to be in great part ouercome, and the profit much more neere, and more easie to come by, yet the Companie wholly affecting the peoples prosperity, haue determined to deale both as fauourably in the Contracts,",
    "1596": "314 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY and as bountifully in all sorts of furniture and prouisions with the Tenants which shall now goe, as they haue done with those, which haue beene formerly sent. Which conditions it hath beene thought fit here to reinserte and publish. Euerie man transported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants to the Commen land of the Company, or to the publike land, shall be freely landed there at the charge of the Company: And shall be furnished with prouisions of victuall for one whole [18] yeare next after his arriuall, as also of Cattle: And with apparell, weapons, tooles and implements, both of house and labour, for his necessary vse. He shall enioy the ratable moytie of all the profits that shall be raised of the land on which he shall be Planted, as well Corne and Cattle, as other commodities whatsoeuer: the other halfe being due to the Owners of the Land. He shall be tyed by Couenant, to continue vpon that Land for the Terme of seauen yeares: which being expired, it shall be in his choyse, whither to continue there or to remoue to any other place, at his owne will and pleasure. Of these persons, one hundred and twenty (such as are to be Tenants) are to be shipped here for Virginia, by the midst of August now at hand: and the rest in January and February ensuing. The next preparations are of Cattle of diuers sorts: whereof there are intended in the next Spring to be sent these ensuing. One hundred Kine, for this addition of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to remaine in a perpetuall stock vpon the Companies Land, to be lent to new Planters, as hath bin formerly ordered. Foure hundred Goats, twenty Mares, fourescore Asses to be procured from France: The care of prouiding which, is commended to diuers select persons by parts, and the whole to the ouer sight of the generall Committees. The last prouisions appointed to be made, are for the setting vp, or increasing of diuers principall Commodities. For Silke, there is prouision to be made, of great store of Silke-worme-seede about Michaelmas [19] next: as also of men skilfull in the ordering as well of the Wormes, as of their Sake, which are to be sent away in a Pinnace, in October betimes. For Hempe and Flaxe, Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, Pitch and Tarre, there is a Treaty already on foote, for procuring of men skilfull in those Trades from the Easterne parts.",
    "1597": "JUNE 22, 1620 315 parts: besides the Polekers yet remaining in Virginia. For Wines, it is also ordered, that men skilfull be procured in the planting and dressing of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence also and other parts to procure Plants of the best kindes. For Oyle, besides great quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia in great abundance, Olive-Plants are to be prouided from Marseilles and Ligorno. For Fish, which on those Coasts are taken in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a course taken, to preserue the Companies Liberties, and to set vp the Fishings in better sort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it in abundance, and after the manner of those hotter Climates, which may prooue a great helpe to increase the Plantation. For Iron, there is sufficient done alreadie. And for Sawing-Milles, besides those already gone this Spring, there are lately come from Hamborough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be sent in the next ship. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates shall be prouided, to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to traffique and trade for the Company and their Tenants vnder his charge. [20] These large supplies of men, Cattle, and Commodities, as they tend to the accomplishing of this great worke of the Plantation: so can they not be themselues effected, without large prouision of money, being the sinewes and mouing Instruments in these great Actions. To which end wee desire the noble and worthy Aduenturers, to be assisting to vs, by such meanes as they shall please: especially that the remaine of all promised Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in without faile, which we trust will now be done cheerefully on all parts, the inuitements of this yeere being well considered: that as the presenting of their first payments, hath been the beginning, so the performance of the later, may be the perfecting and finishing of this worke, so glorious before God and man. And here by the way, for the clearing of some scruples and errors through mistaking of our writings lately published, we are to aduertise, that the Alphabet of Aduenturers and summes aduentured, neither then conueniently",

And whereas diuers other bils of Aduenture, haue bin heretofore deliuered, partly vpon personall aduenture, and no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deserts, partly for summes paid to other men, whose Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treasurors) and partly for goods which neuer came [21] within the Treasurers Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whose hands they were deliuered, for which notwithstanding bils of Aduenture haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treasuror: If the Aduenturors shall be pleased within the time prefixed, to put in their iust claimes, by these or any other wayes whatsoeuer, there shall be right done to them, and a new Alphabeticall booke shall be published, embracing exactly all kinde of Aduenturors, with their seueral summes either really aduentured, or otherwise accepted, allowed or bestowed, be it vpon what cause, or in what kinde soeuer. Now if the Aduenturors be thus requested, with much greater reason are all Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and make perfect their seuerall Accounts, and to pay in those monyes, which shall remaine due to the Company: that so all parts concurring with their duties and endeuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy. Lastly, as heretofore, so we now also declare, that the persons to be admitted to goe, as the Companies-Tenants, and with the foresaid conditions, shall be no other then good men, that is to say, of good Trades, of skill in husbandry, or industrious labourers; and such of those as shall be commended for their honest conuersation: which persons repairing to the Citie of London, to Mr. Ferrar, Deputy to the Company, his house in St. Sithes lane, in the beginning of August, and in the middle of Ianuary, next, according to the seuerall numbers at those times to be sent, shall from thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies char- [22] ges, til such time as they be shipped for Virginia: there being especiall care likewise taken, for the prouiding of good Commanders and Directors of their workes.
