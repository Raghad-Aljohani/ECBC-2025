Wm Powells, for which wee stand accomptable for as much as any your Tenants pay. John Radish was lett out for Rent, but after the Massacre, (being furnished with neither cloathes nor prouision nor well in health) his Mr kept him to find and cloath him onely: There was neither ground for these to plant, nor prouision, and therfore I gaue way that 3 or 4 of them should be lett out: and you see how lost a yeare it was, els there had beene made an agreement for 100 lb of Tob: and three Barrels of corne for each: since Capt.

But they lay al on the short provisions sent wth them: by which means they depart wth most of their corne as soone as it is reaped to discharge their borrowings & besides the Companyes tenants are planted on the barrenest places in al the Country, by reason of your affecting of cleared ground, wch is generally worne out, & vngrateful to the planters.

He is now at Kicotan, drawne thether by Captaine Nuce a little before his death. I have disposed of things there in this manner. I have taken Captaine Whitacres bond to pay you for the tenants, together wth those wch he formerly commanded, a hundred waight of the best tobacco a man, & 15 bushels of corne, (besides a like proportion for themselves) wch is as great a rate as any will do give, & more then most men can make.

Your pinnace lies like a wrack at Elizabeth City; which hath brought in this year not less than 1800 bushels of corn, & yet, which is strange, not any in the Colony so near starving as they. I sent Nun with his fellows (of whom none deserve the name of a shipwright) to view her; who writ the word that 150\u00a3 would not repair her; which was twice as much, if not more, as she cost: but one having offered to buy her, I suspected some knavery, & upon my coming down had her exactly searched, & found that no great matter would renew her: so that I have set both them & others upon her. Yet sails & tackling we shall want except you supply us: & I doubt not but to employ her to your better satisfaction.\n\nThe Vinerouns are placed together at Elizabeth City & altogether employed about silk & silk-worms, that we may preserve the seed & send you home some silk the next year. For the planters are so busied about rebuildings & preparing their grounds, that few, at this time, either can, or will attend them. Yet for my own part I have set 4 to do nothing else: & have prepared the chamber wherein I lie at Lieutenant Perses (the fairest in Virginia) for that purpose. I hear the Frenchmen's times come out the next year: you must use the means to procure their stay, & send more of their quality if you would have that work go really forward.\n\nSince my last letter I have sent my shallop with my servants as far almost as the falls for sand for the Glass men, but can find none that would serve; & since to Cape Henry, where they lighted of that which they like (however send us two or three Hogsheads out of England) if it be not disliked in the trial. All the servants are dead, which you must supply, for the charge is intolerable to hire them: which, with their provisions, lives all upon me, that am not able to feed my own family. And, to give a greater blow to our necessities, the Tygar sent forth a trading with Mr. Puntises pinnace under Captain Spilman (a man wary enough heretofore & acquainted with their treacheries) is not only returned empty, but himself with 26 well armed, sufficient to have defended themselves against 500 Indians, are cut off or taken prisoners; either by ambushes or too much credulity: for as yet we know not the certainty.

And, by the way, to our no little discontentment, we having with great expence set out that ship to Somer Ilands for furnishing the country with their fruits, in print you have given the reputation [to another] Sic vos non vobis.

But Mr. Tucke deserves your thanks, & our commendations. Great are the likelihoods of the vicinity of the South sea by a general report of the Indians: the mountains being, as they say, not past 4 days journey above the falls, they two days over, & rivers on the other side there into of no great length. If I were furnished with means, I would willingly venture my life in that discovery.

Which of them are in the right must appeare by the bookes of Accompte of those tymes, for the Difference is noe lesse then 10000\u00a3, and for the clearinge hereof reffers himself to the bookes. They say 9000\u00a3 this sum was expended (beside voluntary Contributions other sumes of voluntary planters). This Clause (beside voluntary Contributions the sumes of voluntary planters) Comes in the Reare and it is thought might well haue beene spared, for it is not remembred that in those tymes at the beginning of the Plantation there were any of such value in that kinde: especially not before the time by them limited in their declaration viz not before the 18 of December 1618. They say that there were then left 600 persons and 300 Cattle in the Colony. Although this is noe small matter considering the Infancie of the Plantation in those tymes and the many Difficulties they mett withall in their first enterprises, that even with less than the expence of 70000\u00a3 there should be planted so many men and all of them so well provided that even by their owne Confession left these men that sent the name of the Companie of the Authors of this declaration there was for every twoe persons in the Collonie one head of English Cattle then left (beside many other plentiful provisions not mentioned) yet Certainly both the Number of Men and of Cattle was much more than they speake of.

They add further in their Declaration that these 2500 persons now remaining were sent with the expense only of 80000\u00a3 of the public stock besides the charges of particular societies and Planters. To which is answered that it is too gross a self-contradiction of themselves to say that the persons now remaining in Virginia were sent thither at the Charge of the 80000\u00a3 public stock in the Declaration mentioned, whereas they themselves Confess but a few lines before that there were 600 persons of them left there in December 1618, which was long before that public stock was raised so that no part of that stock could be employed about the transportation of 600 of those 2500 persons which as they pretend are now remaining.

But for the Clearinge of the truth herein we say that we conceive that the moneyes expended within these 4 Yeares about this Plantation cannot be lesse than 86000 li. The Reason is this: the 4270 persons which they say have within these 4 Yeares beene exported at the rate of 20 li. a man comes to 85400 li. And that is the proportion which in their printed paper (Called the Inconveniences) they say the Companie usually allowes to the furnishinge of one man. And in the paper of Account how they the Lottery Money was expended which they delivered to his Majesty about twoe Yeares agoe they affirm as much: So that unless they will denye what heretofore they have affirmed, this Collection of the Charge of these last 4 Yeares seemes to be very moderate. For if we abate 400 li. it is the whole of the proportion that they afterward in this declaration that what was spent in other attempts hath produced is in parte discovered. They spent 5000 li. in Iron Workes beside. And what effect that huge expence by what hath beene already sayd and shall hereafter be declared.

Again the Governor Sr. Francis Wyatt 4 April last writes to his father saith thus: They (meaning the Company here) talk of an Army of 500 to issue out upon th\u2019 Indians in all parts and after 1 Rushing Army of 150 to vex them in all places. This joined with the 5 men to keep for the fort would leave some xx men to guard 40 Plantations half a man to each, counting any that were tolerable shot for a man. I know what I say and to whom I speak it. Again we find beside diverse passages in their letters from thence by which we may discern the paucity of the people we find that one William Capps being generally approved as a fit man to be employed against th\u2019 Indians he demanding but 46 30 small shot and 10 men to secure the Boats was as it seems put off with this Reason given in their Counsel there. That if these men should be slain then their whole state were overthrown. By all which we conceive that in truth their numbers are very small and weak: And in great danger either to be utterly ruined either by the Enemy or by famine or both.

And he and myself being then all alone in the great Chamber of my Lord of Warwick's house he told me that he was afraid to discover some things which he knew of Sir Edwin Sandys' proceedings in those businesses, both because he was so upheld privately in his courses as also that he had the strength of the Courts to countenance him in all things and had so carried the business that he would be sure to hide all his own ill actions under the name of the Company: Besides he told me that by his long acquaintance with him & his ways he was induced verily to believe that there was not any man in the world that carried a more malicious heart to the Government of a Monarchy than he Sir Edwin Sandys did: for Capt. Bargrave had heard him say that if ever God from heaven did or doth constitute and direct a form of Government it was that of Geneva: And he hath oft times reprehended Capt. Bargrave that in some written tractates of his, and in his discourses he seemed to dislike the constitution and frame of the present Government of Virginia telling as that which inclines unto if not directly being a popular Government he telling Capt. Bargrave that his intent was to erect a free state in Virginia and other words to that purpose. And to that intent (as Capt. Bargrave affirmed to me) he Sir Edwin Sandys moved my Lord of Canterbury to give leave to the Brownists and Separatists of England to go thither for which my Lord's grace of Canterbury said to Bargrave that he should never like well of Sir Edwin Sandys: those Brownists professing by their Doctrine claiming a liberty to disagreeing to the Government of Monarchies: And the said Capt.

The fortes and other publicq workes and buildings which were erected during Sr. Tho. Smithes time for their defences are ruyned and none in their roome erected since that time. Few or no skillfull citizens of means and experienced governors, leaders and commanders left amongst them or sent over thither during these last years which in our opinion is one of the chiefest causes of the miseries which have befallen them. The publicq stock of the deputy Company which by Lotteries at the beginning of the win these 3 or 4 years brought in about 86000 li, thirty thousand pounds is wholly exhausted. The Company at this time much indebted, the ancient Adventurers it seems to us are much disheartened and so have in a manner of late years deserted the business. As for Staple Commodities we can hear of none that within these 4 years have come from thence. Those few that have been attempted to be raised have miscarried, and the money and labour therein utterly lost: so that we can only say that the estate in general of that plantation is not only miserable and out of your Majesty's but remediless unless it shall please your most excellent Majesty by advice of your tender care and compassion of the most calamitous and distressed estate of your poor Subjects there remaining to give further order and direction for their relief; yet by sending them Corn and other provisions not by way of merchandise as hath lately been used to take advantage of their necessities by making them pay most unconscionable prices, but either by supply with free gift or at such reasonable rates as all their means of sustentation consists only by what the poor people subsist being only by planting Tobacco. That some little may not be taken from them for a little food, but somewhat left to clothe and cherish them: As also that some able citizens and experienced Governors and Commanders may forthwith be sent who may by all means possible provide for their safety and defence, which we conceive against those rude and naked people might without too much difficulty be effected seeing we find it is affirmed that anciently when the Colony consisted of far less number of able persons than now by reducing doth, and yet that so great was their providence of the expert Governors and the Officers in those times that they did not only prevent any such disasters as have lately befallen them by the hands of the Indians, but that contrary.",

But if I should call in question the present governors, whoe beinge not ignorant that the populer goverment doth directlie take away the power of the monarchie and shew what mischeife they have done by their profuse throwinge out libertie, amongst the planters, whereby they have made them forsake their former discipline, strength and vertue to defend themselves against the domestick enemie, and yet beinge fore warned of these thinges it should appeare that they did it knoweingely and wittinglie against the soveraignitie in England, extreame libertie beinge worse then extreame Tirranie, as it appeared by the troubles.\n\n[From the text printed in the American Historical Review, XXVIII, pp. 508-809.]",

There are diuerse small plantations all seated vppon the Rivers sides and accessible by Boates, and before most of them Shipps of 200 Tun may ryde: But the plantations are farr asunder & their houses stande scattered one from another, and are onlie made of wood, few or none of them being framed houses but puncheons sett into the Ground And couered with Boards so as a firebrand is sufficient to consume them all.\n\n3.
