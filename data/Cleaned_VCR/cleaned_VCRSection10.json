The perticular carriages of this first Government, are too long, & would bee too displeasing to your Lo\u1d48\u02e2\u02b0\u1d56\u02e2 cares. But in Generall such it was, as the new Earle of Midd. then Lo: high Treasurer (being an ancient Adventurer & Councellor for Virginia) informed your Lo\u1d48\u02e2\u02b0\u1d56\u02e2, sitting in Counsell the 5\u1d57\u02b0 of March 1622 when he told Alderman Johnson, That in former yeares, when he the said Alderman was Deputie, and the busines was in other handes, it was carried leaudly, so that if they should be called to an accompt for it, their Estates would not answere it. What his Lo\u1d48\u02e2\u02b0\u1d56 delivered as his owne Censure, was truly the opinion of the whole Company of Adventurers here in England. And with them doth the Colonie concurre, having the last yeare by their Viceadmirall sent a writing signed by the hands of the Generall Assembly, & directed to his Ma\u1d57\u02b8, wherein having declared, the manner of those Twelue yeares Government, they conclude with these words, full of passionate griefe: Iud rather then to be reduced to live under the like Government, wee desire his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 that Comissioners may be sent over with authoritie to hang vs. Of this qualitie was the first Government. And answerable to the Forme, were the Effects, as the Generall Assemblie having by oath examined the perticulers, sett downe in their Declaration directed to his late Ma\u1d57\u02b8, 1. For People then alive about the number of 400, 2. Very many of them in want of Corne, utterly destitute of Cattle, Swine, Poultry, and other provisions to nourish them. 3.

In wch regard there was fifteen thousand pounds detained of mens subscriptions, wch by no means they could bee procured to pay in; sundry of them alleaging in their answers in Chauncery upon their oathes, the misimployment of the monyes, & ill keeping of the Accounts.

For the publick Stock being utterly exhaust the yeare before, was not able to contribute 500 li. toward all this charge. But this cruell Tragedy of the Massacre, was seconded by Two other sharpe Calamities in the very neck one of another: First Scarcity in the Colony by being putt off from their Grounds prepared, together with the losse of their season & much seed; besides that, through the troublesomnes of those tymes, they could not freely inploy themselves in planting thereof, no not in those their scant grounds, many Plantations being drawne into few places for their better defence. The pestering of themselves, did likewise breed Contagious sicknesse; which being increased by the Infection brought in by some shipps, there dyed that yeare of Mortality neere upon 600 more: and the Colony passed much hardnesse in their victuall, by reason of the miscarriage of one of their Shippes, which the Company sett forth with above 500 li. worth of Meale and other provisions: But the Shipp being blowne up with Powder at the Summer Islandes, the Provisions were lost, & never came to Virginia. Notwithstanding these things were most grievous to the Company here; yet were they no wayes of Discouragement, but rather seemed to add heat to their former zeale: so as by the beginning of the yeare 1623 there appeared in readines & preparation to goe to Virginia, double that number of people, & Adventurers, that any former yeare had carried.

As for the people that went that yeare in those Eleaven ships, the nomber was not above 260: and those procured not without difficulty, so much had the disgrace of the Plantation spread amongst the Common sort of people: Neither could it be prevented by the Companie, although they vsed all possible dilligence: soliciting the Comissioners then appointed by his Majestie by a publick Examination of Captayne Butlers reporte, to cleare the truth. But they would by no meanes bee drawne therevnto. As for the Companie it selfe, their proceedings & demeanour were soe opprobriously calumniated: as deprived them both of abillitie & credit to doe any good herein: but with much sorrowe to behold how sensibly and dangerously the good opinion of this Action decayed; so that divers Preachers of note in the Cittie that had begunne in this latter Governement to pray continually for Virginia, left quite the remembrance of it: finding the Action to growe either odious or contemptible in mens minds: which yet but a little before was of that esteeme, as divers on their death beds gaue great Legacies to the furtherance thereof: and even from the East Indies by way of Contribution, hath bin sent by the Factors and poore Marriners above 1000 pounds Sterling so farr was the reputation of this Action spread, by the prosperinge thereof vnder the latter Governement, & by their zealous & sollicitous endeavours.

Thus haue wee given your Lo\u2019 a true Information, both of the growth and languishinge of the Virginia Plantation, in these Five latter yeares [7] Government: wherein no encombrances, no calamities whatsoever could keepe it soe downe, but that it did yearely advance it selfe with a most remarkeable growth, whilst the carefull Nurse and tender Mother the Company was permitted to governe it. Though contagion & sword destroyed many people: yet whilst the number of new did doubly supply those that fayled, it cannot be said, but the Action was in a thriving, in a prosperous course; though not in a cleare or easy. Then began it to stand, when the Companie was troubled; to stagger, when they were disgracd and discountenanced; to sincke, when they were terrifyed with affrightment of Dissolution; since which tyme there hath bin nothing at all done towards the recovery or helping it forward, but much towards the hindringe & bringing it lower. The poore supply of People & shippes that are gone, are but the remaynder of the late Companies cares & loves. The setters out of the best of them doe affirme, that if they had not beene so farr engaged before the vnexpected dissolution of the late Companie, they would haue drawne back their Adventures & People. When they shall arive in Virginia, they will not bring either comfort or supply to the Colonie: but only add to their Calamitie, to their greife. The first Shipp went in August, victualled only for Three moneths: the next in October: neither of them were arived the 25th of February last. Whereby they must needs come into Virginia in most miserable distresse. The other two went out soe meanly provided, that how euer short their voyage shalbe, they cannot but prove an insupportable charge to the Colony, much disfurnished by the victualling of divers shipps lately returned thence, and so ill provided by a deceiptfull cropp, which seemed large, but proved scant, as wee dare not but acquaynt your Lo\u2019. what experience.",

There is likewise in the Colony a most dangerous want of Powder, so great, as if the Savages should knowe the advantage they haue thereby, they might easily in one day destroy all o people. There is most extreame want of hose, shooes, & all apparrell, even to a dangerous empeachement of their healthes: and that so generall, as the provisions carried in these late Shipps, will not as farr as wee cann learne, supply the Tenth part of their necessities. The want of such wonted supplies, will vndoubtedly much dismay & deiect the Colony. But when they shall vnderstand of the Companies dissolueon, for the continuance of whose Governemt and the Liberties they enioyed vnder them, they were most importunate suitors to his Ma\u1d57\u2071\u1d49, and that they are returned vnder those handes w\u1d57\u02b0 they so much abhorred: Wee doubt no possible meanes wilbe found to keepe the greatest and best part of the Colonie from imediatly cominge away.

As for adventuringe hence, what by the disgracinge of the Action it selfe, & the undeserved suffrings of the late Companie, the businesse is brought to such a stand, as seemes incredible: there being no preparation that wee can heare of not only of any Shipp, but of any man to goe to Virginia, Whereas commonly for divers yeares before, there were foure or five shipps in readinesse, and as many hundreds of men, at this tyme of ye yeare. So that even in that regard also, the Colony will find themselves both in great discomfort, & great danger. For although formerly they had no Forte on the Land to hinder a forraigne Enemy: yet especially in the latter tymes, there was such aboundance of Shipping cominge and goinge continually to Virginia, that there hath bin sometymes told Seaventeene sayle together in James River. Whereby besides that it was a continual terror to the Natives, it would haue bin a difficult thinge to endamage the Colonie, w'out the power both of many Shippes, & many souldiers.

Thirdly the present extreme poverty & consumption of the Plantation, being for want of the accustomed yearly supplies, reduced to that paucity of men, & want of all sorts well near of necessary provisions, that it cannot be restored, but with an huge expense, no less almost than to set up a new Plantation. Now touching the disreputation of the Action, and the general disheartening of the Adventurers & Planters, such especially as have spared neither pains nor expense, for the recovering, supporting & advancing the Plantation: We humbly crave your Lordships' favorable patience, though we somewhat enlarge ourselves in this place, to present in part the Injustices & grievances of those wounds to the honorable minds & skillful hands of your Lordships: Seeing that in our understanding, the curing of them by your Lordships, may be a means to revive again the generally deaded hearts of both Adventurers & Planters, & to add a new lustre & grace to the Action. Amongst the many glorious works of the late King, there was none more eminent, than his Gracious inclination, together with the propagation of Christian Religion, to advance & set forward a new Plantation in the new world. Which purpose of his continued till the last, manifested by his Majesty's many public & private speeches by divers Letters of his, & by his sundry Proclamations: at their faults are far the greater, who, as immediately shall be declared, did maliciously and cunningly pervert those Gracious intentions of his Majesty by scandalizing the Government as it then stood, as neither convenient here, nor likely there to advance the prosperity of the Colonie; and by insinuating assurances, that they themselves would maintain that work by better means. Which his Majesty conceiving (as it was reason) they would not so boldly have promised of themselves, being so great a work, unless they had had both knowledge, & means to go thorough with it; did also believe: & so they became the Undertakers. And now, as it hath been ever far from our practice, and against our present Desires, to fall upon the persons of any men, where the necessity & justice of the cause doth not necessarily require it: yet at this time it is impossible to clear this point to your Lordships without [Li] naming some of their persons, and particularizing their Actions.

And of this, and of the bad effects of it, all our bookes, & memories are full, But yet by Gods assistance, & the unwearied courage of the Companie, wee ridd out this storme. The next blowe, as wee had reason to believe, proceeding by their underhand raysinge of new spiritts, drawne to disturbe vs for their owne gayne was the bringing in of new & severall projects concerning Tobacco: wch was for the instant the only commoditie whereby the Planters mayntayned themselves. And so under colour of advancing profitt to his Maty sometimes (as hath bin before touched) wee were forbidden to bring in any Tobacco, sometimes to bring in but a small quantitie, and sometimes comaunded to bring in all, Wch varying directions, did so distract & confound the Adventurers & Planters, that it had in a manner ruynd the Plantation. But yet by Gods assistance, & the constancy of ye Companie, wee ridd out this storme also. The instruments in this worke, that especially appeared were the then Sr. Lionell Cranfield, Mr. Jacob, and some others: to the extreme damage of the Company, enrichement of themselves, & deceyt of his Maty: as was at large expressed & offered to be proved in ye last Parliament.

The Earle of Middesex then Lo: high Treasuror of England, who in respect of his place was to take into consideracon all thinges that had relacon to his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 revenue, did first propound to Sr. Edwin Sandis, & afterwards to the Ea: of Southampton, the Lo: Cavendish & Sr. Edwin Sandis together, that the King, he knewe, had by Sr. Thomas Smithes meanes & Alderman Johnsons, and some great freinds & instruments of theires, bin strangely possessed agaynst the forme of our Governem\u1d57, & the consequences of it: & particulerly that they had made such advantage by traducing the names of the Earle of Southampton and Sr. Edwin Sandis, that the busines of the Plantacon fared the worse for their sakes, That he had allready in Generall spoken w\u1d57\u02b0 his Ma\u1d57\u02b8, & assured him, that the whispers & rela\u00e7ons of those men, had an eye to their owne safetie, and not to the Colonies good; and that therevpon the King referred the whole consideracon of the Plantation, and what was best to be done, to his care. Vpon this he propounded vnto those before named, that the best way to engage the Kinge in his care of the Plantations, and to make it impossible for any hereafter to disturbe the Companie, as they had formerly done, was to thinke of some such meanes, whereby the proffitt of his Ma\u1d57\u02b8, & the good of the Plantation, might hand in hand goe together. And to speake truth, though those he spoke w\u1d57\u02b0, were at first very vnwilling to swallowe this guilded pill, as having heard of the stile he vsed in negotiatinge other businesses of this nature: yet he was so full of protesta\u00e7ons in it, euer pretending ex || the Companies || good, and w\u1d57\u02b0 all procured further intima\u00e7on to the Earle of Southampton, that no service of his could be more acceptable to his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 then this now propounded: that Vpon these protesta\u00e7ons & assurance, they engaged themselues to treat of a Contract betweene his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 & the Companies. In the making whereof, the said Earle of Midd remembred not his promised care of the Plantations, but in truth from one degree to another, wrested vs to such condi\u00e7ons, & such a rate, as was very dammageable to the Plantations. But vpon serious debate in many & full Courts, vpon the whole matter wee were resolved, considering the protection of the Colonies, & fauour promised; and to be free from those frequent projects that in former tymes had so much wronged & disturbed vs, to accept an hard bargayne: conceavinge that though it were not so good as wee desired, & was fitt to haue bin offerd; yet by it wee should...",

And so in Michaelmas terme 1622 this Contract we began to be treated of in Easter terme, was concluded by the subscription of the Earle of Middlesex his hand, and by sending the Company word, that that day the whole Counsell board had given their assent therevnto, wch was the first tyme the Companie vnderstood that they had heard of the matter. [13] The Contract thus concluded, a great Tempest arose, by what seerett cause & vnderhand procurement, wee may guesse, but cannot affirme. But in a Court of the Company vpon the 4th of December followinge, one Mr. Wrote Cosen Germane to the Earle of Middlesex (discontented also that hee was passed ouer in the election of Officers.) did with a passionate & blastring speech, inveigh agaynst the Contract, & the menaging thereof with Sallary; agaynst the proceeding in the Treaty of it, as that it had bin vnduly and vniustly carried, that men had bin overawed; and that it had bin procured to private ends. Whereof not being able to make any shadowe of proofe, & persisting still in his violent & contemptuous demeanor, vpon a full hearinge, he was thrust out of the Companie; and vpon that ioyned himselfe to Sr. Thomas Smith, Alderman Johnson & the opposite party, & drewe also with him Two more of his Companions, and so now made shewe of a formall party agaynst the Company. But for all this wee still mayntayned the reputacon of our proceeding.\n\nThe next of troubles in order, (proceeding from what secrett cause, that wch followes will give your Lo? more reason of coniecture, then wee will now affirme,) was that this opposite party then attayned to about 25 in nomber, had some seerett encouragement or other given them, directly to oppugne the Contract; wch, as is before declared, was so formally made: And gave some reasons in writing agaynst it to the then Lord Tr\u00e9r; who receaving them, gave the Company first suspicon of double intelligence & indirectnes in his dealinge. But howsoever, the Earle of Southampton, the Lo: Cavendish, Sr. Edwin Sandis & some other, being called by the Earle of Middlesex to his Chamber at Whitehall, then thought, that they had given such answeres to them, as that his Lo? rested satisfied.

And vpon hearing there of their accusations, and of answeres, the Earle of Middlesex, who assumed the chiefe knowledge & care of that busines, did in the close of that hearinge vse the words formerly rehearsed, Of the leaud carriage in former tymes, and of the latter in a manner miraculous recoverie. A greater testimony of our integritie & their guilt, could not be given. But as the sequell will manifest, & as wee haue since found in other of his Lor[dship's] proceedings, he meant to loose nothing by those words. [14] Howsoeuer it was, & whatsoever wee suspect, not intending now to dive into those miseries; from that day forward, to the Conclusion of this busines he professedly made himselfe the patron to that side, & enemy to the Company; for which wee appeale to your Lordships' better knowledge. Afterward about that Contract were divers meetings before the Lorde, where it was principally inveighed against by Sr. Nathaniell Rich, speaking against the injustice & unconscionablenes of it; protesting that he had euer sold his Tobacco for Fiue shillings a pound one with another, and that euery pound cost him Two shillings six pence in the Sumer Islands: and now to give a Third away to the King & peradventure the price not to be much higher, was against Justice & Conscience. And here by the way, wee humbly craue leaue to say thus much, that his Conscience now serues him in this new Contract, to force the Planter & the Adventurer to sell their Tobaccos, the best sort for 2s. 4d. and the second sort at sixteene pence a pound. But vpon that former Demonstrative Argument of his, though it were so fully answered as nothing could be more, yet the Earle of Middlesex tooke his ground to condemne the Contract he had signed, as hurtfull to the Plantations; and to comaund the Companies to thinke of propounding a better & to bring it in writing within Two daies: Which was accordingly done: and therein shewed, that the hardnesse of this Contract, was not by the Companies proposition, but by his Lordship's pressure. And therefore vrged what had bin offred to his Lordship at the first; that his Majesty would be contented with a fourth, & not require a Third of the Tobacco, To which in great scorne his Lordship replyed that take Two pence out of Six pence there would remayne a Groat.

The Contract thus dissolved, as publicly damageable, by the encouragement of the Earle of Middlesex, & industry of the Five and twenty before mentioned, (that so place might be made for this [15] Latter Contract, so privately beneficiall, for so by the effect it hath appeared): the Government was now likewise to be questioned and altered, or else they compassed not their ends. Which to bring about, these two ways were used: First a petition was delivered to his Ma'y by Alderman Johnson, in the name of the rest, inveighing against the latter Government, & magnifying the former. And in the end, desiring a Commission to examine the proceedings of these last Fower years. This Petition was by the Company at large answered to his Ma'ty, & we joined in the point of having our Actions examined by the Commission: but withall thought it just, & desired, that their Twelve years Government before might be also examined: Which accordingly was ordered. The second means used by them, was to raise up Captayne Butler, who hasting from the Sumer Ilandes to Virginia, where he stayed but a few weeks, upon his returne delivered to his Ma'ty, a Paper called The Unmasking of Virginia. The substance of which was, first the dispraise of the Country, & making of it an unfit place for any English Colony; & next, scandalizing the Government of it, both here, & there. What concerned the Colonie, was proved to be false by Forty witnesses: who chanced to be in Towne then, & had bin often & long in the Colonie: And was endeavored to be maintained by him by two means only: one by practicing to get the hande of Two men unto it, to whom he owed money & deferred payment: who when they heard it read in Co', protested that they never saw what they set their hands to, and that Capt: Butler told them it was to a Paper, which he would show the King for the good of the Plantation: and desired the Companies pardon; for whatsoever was there said was false. Secondly he would have made it to have been better believed, by a forged Letter which he brought to Sr. John Bourchier from his daughter Mrs. Whittakers: who knew it.",

But since, both shee & her husband being come ouer, they both forsweare it, & say it was none of her doing nor direction. But howsoeuer, by those meanes the opposite party thus farre obteyned their ends, that by the Defamation, and this trouble ensuinge, a very great number that intended to haue gone ouer, were discouraged. But yet for all this, the Companie knewe their cause to be so just and justifiable, that they did not abandon it: but prepared themselues to give divers charges before the Comission, agaynst divers of the partie opposite; & professed themselues ready to make their owne defence whensoever they should be charged. But whilst the Comission sate, farther to discourage vs, first of all our Bookes, & after the Minutes of them were sent for away from vs: that none of the Letters that then came from Virginia were to be seene by vs, being all seazed on by the Comission. But touching the rest of the Cariage of that Comission, because it was at large delivered in Parliament, & offered to be proved, if further proceeding in that businesse had not bin forborne vpon a Letter written to the house from his Maiestie, wee will now to your Lordship say only this; That whatsoever was brought by vs concerninge Accounts, Depredation, misgovernement, & diuers other crimes, agaynst perticuler persons, was by this Comission, (especially directed by the Earle of Midd,) shufled of for all the tyme, till the Comission was even at the end, and nothing done vpon them. And on the Contrary, whatsoever could be gathered out of the fragments of Letters from discontented persons in Virginia, concerning either the place or governement was diligently collected by them, and receaued by the Earle of Middlesex, as a great testimony agaynst vs; and would not take those other Letters for proofe which wee euer guided ourselues by, and came from the Governour and Counsell there. And lastly some three days before their Comission ended, they putt vs on a sodayne to answere to 39 Articles, or else they would take them pro confesso. This they thought for vs impossible to doe. But wee deceaved their expectation; and they could not find in the least perticuler, any just ground to make any report agaynst vs. \n\n1 Manuscript illegible, but it may be\u2014\"but answered that she was sick\".",

The Earle of Midd replyed it was a matter of so great importance, & concerned the lives of so many of the Kings Subjects, that if yt Companie would not presently take order for sending Supplies, the State would call in their Pattent.

Well Captaine Butler having bin forewarned of by some friends of his, left his Government before he had leave, and before the arrival of the Comission: Having first there endeavoured to alienate the minds of the people from the forme of Government here. But he was no sooner come home, & delivered to his Maty The Vnmasking of Virginia before spoken of, but there was an end of Don Carlo Di Colomars prosecution. We have related the particulars; & make no application.\n\nAs for the late Comission, which hath succeeded in the place of the Company; if we might have seen the business seriously taken into the Grave cares, & prosecuted with the Noble pains of those most honoble personages, whose names are inserted in the said Comission: we should have hoped to have seen some good effect [19] befitting their great & eminent worth. But whilst their more weighty Affaires have hindered them, the business hath bin principally carried only by those persons, that were the chief Opposers of the late Company. For although there be named divers worthy Gentlemen, & Citizens likewise, in the Comission: yet as we understand, the most of them have forborne altogether to appear at any meetinge. Wherefore when either in our words or thoughts, we complain of any proceedings of the late Comission; we always except both all those persons of Honour, & indifferency: and only intend those others, whose stomachs were so great, as they durst undertake the overthrowing of the late Company; and yet their hearts so narrow, as they have not dared to adventure all of them during these Nine months, as far as we can learn, one five pounds to the advancement or subsistence of the Plantation.\n\nBy the publick Letters of the Governour delivered them in July last, they were plainly understood of the extreme want of Powder in the Colonie: and were often told from us of the great danger that might ensue thereby. Yet did they neglect the sending of any in the first Shipp, or in the Second: but about Christmas, & since in March, they have sent a small quantity, obtained by his late Maty gift (as we hear) out of the Tower. \n\n[In pencil.]",
    "2625": "APRIL (?), 1625\n\nThis did not the late Company: who upon notice of the Massacre, did by the first shipp send 42 Barrells of Powder; for halfe whereof the Officers having disbursed the mony, are yet unsatisfied. Whereas all the Fower shippes now sent, were prepared in the Company's tyme; these last Commissioners callinge in the Comissions graunted them by the late Company, made them take newe as from themselues; that so they might glory upon anothers foundation: But whilst they thus hunted after windy ambition, hindringe the two first Shipps from takinge a faire winde; they have bin the causes of all the lamentable calamities & distresses, wch in so long voyages must needs befall them. The principall scope of his late Ma[jes]ties Comission to them, as wee understand, was, that they should finde a better forme of Government for the Plantations advancement; and therein is especially promised the conservation of euery mans right. Intentions worthy the wisedome & Justice of so great a Prince. But as far as wee can understand, these Commissioners have done nothing towards either of these ends: But quite contrary to the second. \n\nBy an unknowne Contract, wch themselues will not so much as declare, much lesse are able to defend; they have sought to share amongst themselues, twice as much upon euery mans goods, as they will leaue to the Owner thereof. And although they say only three of them are Contractors yet wee cannot believe it; having observed the ends of some of them for many yeares, to have constantly bin bent to the compassing of some such advantage, as they have now by this bargayne gayned. It is constantly reported that they have liberally given that wch was not their owne, to those who have no right thereto; as namely the Colonies Mine to Sr. Samuell Argoll, & Mr. Woodall surgion to Sr. Thomas Smith. But this & all their other proceedings are kept in great secrett: wch breeds suspition that they have not bin good; else why doe they fly the Light? This is cleane contrary to the use of the late Company: who did all thinges in publick: wch was a cause of as great satisfaction, as this of Distaste. And as in this, so in all other thinges do they proceed cleane contrary to all right in of understandinge. They publish their Intention of imployinge Sr. Samuell Argoll & Captaine Butler for Governours agayne in the Plantations.",

How they should make the Colony encrease by these means, which will bring home most of them that are there already, wee cannot imagine. Neither are Sr. Thomas Smith nor Alderman Johnson fit or likely men to reunite the late Companie, or to drawe them on to any thinge for the Plantations advancement: since as the whole world knowes, the late Companie have not only always conceaved extremely ill of them, but in the yeare 1623. putt up publick weevsaGoms against them, of very dangerous Consequence. As for the Colony, your Lot have formerly heard their like opinions. Nor can the late Companie conceive, Mr. Wrote, a fit Instrument to sett forward the busines; whome they thought unworthy to bee of their Societie. Nor that those who out of pretence for New-Englands good, have truly wronged Virginia, should now runne a right way for the behoofe thereof. Nor in sum, that those who have little or no interest in the Plantation, should be so sensible of it as were fit. In which number we account Sr. Nathaniel Rich; who to our knowledge hath not adventured anything for the good thereof but contrary wise hath been so perpetually a hinderer, & disturber of the Action, that the body of the Company, addressed a Petition of Complaint, to the last Parliament, craving justice against him, for his injurious & most unworthy practises. [21] Nor that they that mean not to adventure anything, will be able to persuade others to do that which themselves forbear. Nor that ever they will do the Adventurers of the late Companie right, in matters of their Estates; that have so violently endeavoured to do them wrong in their Honor & Reputations: having intended as themselves write, a Reformation & Correction of the Original Court books of the late Companie then possessed by them, if they could have got into their hand certain copies of them which Mr. Nicholas Ferrar late Deputy had at his own charges caused to be transcribed.

As for their resolucions of ordering the busines, wee cannot say any thinge, because wee heare nothinge, and wee doubt they meane nothinge. For all that wee heare tends only to nothing. They dislike the sending of nombers of men. They professe the reducinge of all tradinge to a Joynt-stock or Magazine: which courses in our iudgements tend directly to the subversion of the Plantation, at least to the appropriatinge of it to themselues which to haue bin the mayne end of some of them, the late Counsell & Companie for Virginia, haue vpon strong presumption bin long agoe induced to belieue: and therefore haue now thought themselues bound to declare it, that your Lordships in your Noble wisedomes may make such due preuention as shalbe fitt: humbly beseechinge that this perticuler examination of their Actions & persons, may not be interpreted to proceed from private spleene, but only from a sincere desire of the Plantations advancement.

All which being wearied out with their mallice and iniuries, and louth to spend more of their lives in so vnthankfull a service, are humble suitors vnto your Lordships, that they may be spared from all farther employment in this Action.

But yet that, vpon such condi\u00a2ons, as wee hold most necessary for the effecting of so great a worke, that is, some impediments to bee removed, & some encouragements to be given to it.\n\nIt hath bin a great errour, for any to imagine, that the persons of these men, who haue of late thus opposed the Companie, were either in nomber considerable, or in adventure to be valued any way at all, to further or advance the prosperity of the Plantation: but rather on the contrary, great impediments to the faire proceeding of it: And therefore whereas the late Companie, haue by the vniust practises of divers of these, and",

In the weighing whereof, wee haue divided our thoughts into these three branches: If his Ma'ty should be pleased himselfe to vndertake the Plantation, and the charge thereof to be defrayed out of his Royall Treasure; or otherwise at the Generall charge of the Kingdome: Wee hold it out of question, that",

But if the burden & charge must be borne by the Adventurers and Planters themselves; Wee hold it necessary in that case, that y\u1d49 Governm\u1d57 thereof be also commended by his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 to them, incorporated as before into a Legall Companie: yet so, as to be assisted & advised by a Councell to be appoynted by his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 & bound by oath vnto him; and they also to haue reference in all causes of greatest & extraordinary importance, to his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 himselfe, or to the Lords of his privy Counsell, from thence to take resolu\u00e7on & direction, as was formerly instituted, and in the latter times also practised. And this is agreeable to y\u1d49 com\u0304on vsage of the world, & in perticuler of this Nation: experience having manifested, that men are difficultly drawne to adventure any great matter in these Actions, in y\u1d57 ordering of w\u1d9c\u02b0 they haue no voice or interest. For as for this late third way of Governement, by an absolute Comission, disprovided of other meanes, saue what should be raysed from y\u1d49 Plantacon experience hath taught, that it cann worke no great effect, the hearts of all the Adventurers being turned away from the Action, & y\u1d49 Plant\u1d50 there in great part, vpon the bare feare & forerunning rumour of this Comission, resolving to come away & desert the Plantation. Howbeit, if such of y\u1d49 Comissione\u02b3\u02e2 themselves, as formerly enioyed or partaked, & now affected this Governement, would haue opened their owne purses, as was promised to his late Ma\u1d57\u1d57, for the support of the Plantation: [25] it might perhaps haue bin continued on for some longer tyme: Whereas now all men avoiding to adventure vnder them, & they not disposed to give example in that kind, but rather to agitate and frame Contracts, whereby themselves might growe rich, though w\u1d57\u02b0 the penury & consumption of the Generall Plantacon: the Colonie there doth wast by hasty Degrees, and will suddaynly come to nothing if speedy, remedy be not provided.

And this encouragement would be greatly encreased, if by his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 Royall authoritie, with consent of Parliament, both Plantations might be annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, according vnto the commendable pollicie of some other great Kingdoms.

A greate reuenue peradventure maye be raysed for a yeare or two, but if the Plantation decaye the revenue cannot last: And thus it had beene, if the last Contract had gon on; though the immense gayne had come to the Contractors themselues & not to his Mat.\n\nBut now for ourselues, it is true A Contract was formerly treated of betwixt the Company, and the Earle of Middlesex, but as hath been before read vnto your Lor\u00ae\u00ae though it were then extreame hard, yett it is nowe impossible, by reason of the worse case the Plantation stand in nowe, then it did then, principally occasioned by the discouradgement giuen to the Company.\n\nWee acknowledge vnto your lor\u2019, that the bestewinge banishinge of all Spanish Tobacco, will much redound to the Plantations benifitt, and his",
