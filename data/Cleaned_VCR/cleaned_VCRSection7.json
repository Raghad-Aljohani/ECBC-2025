We have conferred the wholl gouernment of all our people and affayres ioyntly by one other Comission vpon yourselfe and Mr. Tracy accordinge to the tenor of the former to Captayne Woodleefe, makinge noe doubt of your prudent vsage therof, profitably also for yourselves and vs: wherin if difference in execution arise betwene yee we have taken order for vmperinge therof, as by other Covenant quadripartite amongst vs may appeare, wherof one part is sent for you to seale and returne agayne to vs by this ship. We pray you forget not to procure an effectuall tre or other declaration from Sr. George Yardley that he wholly wayveth any entermedlinge in our plantation or affayres, vnder or by colour of that Indenture wch we heretofore passed in his name and our owne, wch we suppose he will readily doe, as vnwillinge to pay in redy mony in England \u00a3450 wch his fifth part at least cometh to, with the wages for hire of this Ship and of the Mr. and maryners: His last tres give vs also a kynd of assurance therof. For many respects we hold it expedient to vse expedition in passinge our patent from the company here for th\u2019 inheritance of our land or some part therof, wherfore we pray you to get the same measured bounded and plotted (wch Thomas Kemis vndertaketh out of his owne sufficiency exactly to pforme) And to procure from the governor such certificat as the nature of that busines and the vsage of the country there doe requyre, wherin we pray your best diligence [130] and myndfullnes and returne therof by this ship: for which by our Charter party we are to pay for six monthes hire, though shee returne in shorter space. Your care also must be to procure a certificat from the gouernor and secretary of the arryvall of the fifty persons (or more) wch we nowe ship for plantation, and are particularly mentioned in the certificat of the mayor of Bristoll, wherof Mr. Tracy hath a copy; we pray you to be carefull in the receipt of such materialls, tooles and implements of husbandry and other furnitures and provisions, aswell nowe sent in this ship as wch were sent in the former to our and your owne excessive charges, and to cause exact Inventories therof to be made the better to requyre due accompts from such as vnder you shall have the charge of them.",

Since the writing of my last letter I have receaved ten young Kine, they thrive very well and I thinke are all with calfe, I have railed in for them with a firme substantial rail two hundred acres of ground. Concerning the ould men I wrote nothing to you because I had not then receaved them home which were putt out, the names of those that are both living and dead are herein inclosed: After I had gathered in the Cropp I enquired of Sr George what his pleasure was I should doe with it, and he answered that he thought you did expect...",

There was owing into the store for fifteen hundred of fish, at three pound fifteen shillings the hundred, for wooden platters, spikes, iron pots [and] cans four hundred and fourscore weight of tobacco. The tobacco which was due unto them that died for the time they lived, he gave unto me, for which I thank you and him unto whom I have many ways been beholding, whose life, government, and proceedings I cannot but admire. The fish he sent to me with the new men because their provisions of meal and oil were short: I received one. I have for this year caused as many to work upon other trades beside the ground as I could, both for the handsomer building in my plantation, and benefit of the Colonie, and my own ease: I have appointed four Carpenters, three sawyers, two Smiths, three tailors. The rest plant Corn and Tobacco, for vines we cannot go about it with courage until such time as we may have such plants as we know are good and will be worth our labour, which we expect out of England. It is without question, that they will prosper exceeding well, by the next year I think Sir George will be able to furnish some of us out of his own vineyard as also with silk-worm-seed.

In the mean tyme they are so disheartned with the entertaynment they finde here, that they are growne very ympatient of stay. And these men when they fall to worke, must haue all their help from the Companies people: and it may fall out to be in such a place that all yow haue yet will not satisfie. And how shall they doe that and look after their own lyvelihood? The Collony will afford no help toward it, since (as they say) the benefitt thereof goes to yo' Company. I am in a straite.

The Countrey called Virginia (so named by the late Virgin-Queene Elizabeth of blessed memory) being the rightfull inheritance of his Maiesty, as being first discouered at the costs and charges of that most prudent Prince of famous memory, King Henry the Seauenth, his Maiesties great Grandfather; The Patent whereof still extant to be seene, was granted to John Cabot and diuers other of his subiects, who went thither with sixe Saile of Ships, and discouered as farre as from Cape Florida to New-found-land, all along the Coast, and tooke possession thereof to the Kings vse, about that time when Ferdinando and Isabella discouered the Westerne Indies: (by which title of first discouery the King of Portugal and Spaine hold and enioy their ample and rich Kingdomes in their Indies East & West:) A coast where King Edward the Sixt after planted his fishing to the New-found-land by publike Act in Parliament, and of which Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlow tooke againe possession to the vse of the late Queene Elizabeth: and after them, [8] Sir Richard Greenfield, Sir Ralph Lane, and Sir Walter Rawleigh; at what time seuerall Colonies were there placed.

This spatious and fruitful Country of Virginia, is (as is generally knowne to all) naturally rich, and exceedingly well watered, very temperate, and healthfull to the Inhabitants, abounding with as many naturall blessings, and replenished with as goodly Woods, and those full of Deere and sundry other beasts for mans sustenance; and the Seas and Riuers thereof (many therein being exceeding fayre and nauigable) as full of excellent fish of diuers sorts, and both water & land yeelding as great variety of fowle, as any Country in the world is knowne to afford. The situation whereof being neere the middest of the world, betweene the extremities of heate and colde, seemes to partake of the benefits of both, and therby becometh capable of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. From whence ariseth an assurance [4] that (by the assistance and skill of industry) those rich Furres, Cordage, and other Commodities, which with difficulty and danger are now drawn from Russia, will be had in Virginia and the parts adioyning, with ease and safety. And the Masts, Plancks, and Boards, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, which now are fetched from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, will there be had in abundance. The Iron, which hath so wasted our English Woods, (that it selfe in short time must decay together with them) is to be had in Virginia (where wasting of Woods is an ease and benefit to the Planter) for all good conditions answerable to the best Iron of the world, whereof proofe hath beene made. The Wines, Fruits, and Salt of France and Spaine: the Silkes of Persia and Italy, will be had also in Virginia, in no kinde of worth inferiour, where are whole Woods of many miles together of Mulberry trees of the best kindes, the proper food of the Silke-worme, and a multitude of other naturall commodities.

And for Corne, Cattell, and Fish, (which are the substance of the food of man) in no place better: the Graine also of our owne Country prospering there very well; but their Maize (being the naturall Graine of Virginia) doth farre exceed in pleasantnesse, strength, fertilitie, and generalitie of use, the Wheat of England. The Cattell which were transported thither (being now growne neere to fifteene hundred) doe become much bigger of body then the breed from whence they came. The Horses also (through the benefit of the Climate, and nature of their feeding) more beautifull and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertilitie of that soyle, that the Does of their Deere (a kinde differing from ours in England, yet no way inferiour) yeeld two Fawnes at a fall or birth, and sometimes three. And the Fishings along our Coasts are in plenty of Fish equall to those of New-found-land, and in greatnesse and goodnesse much superiour, and twice in the yeare to be taken, in their going and returne, which is not else-where found in such plenty and varietie; So as there went this yeare from diuers parts of this Kingdome, neere thirty Saile thither, who are well returned and richly fished.

And for the Passage thither, and Trade there, it is free from all restraint by forren Princes, whereunto most of our other accustomed trades are subiect: there is neyther danger in the way, through [6] the encountring of the Enemy or Pyrate, nor meeting with Rockes or Sholes (by reason of the fayre and safe passage thorow the maine Ocean) nor tediousnes of journey, which by reason of better knowledge then in former yeares (the fruit of time and obseruation) is oftner made and in fewer weekes, then formerly it was wont.",

The Letters of Mr. Porey (verified also from the Gouernor and Councell) aduertised of a late Discouery by him and others made into the great Bay Northward, (reseruing the sounding of the bottome thereof for a second Voyage,) where hee left setled very happily neare an hundred English, with hope of a good trade for Furres there to be had. From thence was brought by Lieutenant Perkinson, in his voyage, some of that kind of Earth which is called Yerra Lemnia (there to be had in great abundance) as good as that of Turkey. By this (though it be but in part) the Reader may vnderstand the great riches and blessings of this excellent Countrey, which euen ordinary diligence and care must needes strangely improue. But that all men may see the vnpartiall ingenuity of this Discourse, we freely confesse, that the Countrey is not so good, as the Natiues are bad, whose barbarous Sauagenesse needs more cultivation then the ground it selfe, being more ouerspread with incivilitie and treachery, then that with Bryers. For the land being tilled and vsed well by vs, deceiued not our expectation, but rather exceeded it farre, being so thankfull as to returne an hundred for one. But the Sauages though neuer Nation vsed so kindly vpon so small desert, haue in stead of that Haruest which our paines merited, returned nothing but Bryers and thornes, pricking euen to death many of their Benefactors: yet doubt wee not, but that as all wickednes is crafty to vndoe it self, so these also, thorow our sides, haue more wounded themselues then vs, God Almighty making way for seueritie there, where a fayre gentlenesse would not take place. The occasion whereof thus I relate from thence. The last May there came Letters from Sir Francis Wiat Gouernor in VIRGINIA, which did aduertise that when in Nouember last he ariued in VIRGINIA, and entred vpon his Gouernment, he found the Country setled in a peace (as all men there thought) sure and vnuiolable, not onely",

And such was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or neuer a sword worne, and a Peece seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle. By which assurance of securitie, the Plantations of particular Aduenturers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground inuited them, and the further from neighbors held the better. The houses generally set open to the Sauages, who were alwaies friendly entertained at the tables of the English, and commonly lodged in their bed-chambers. The old planters (as they thought now come to reape the benefit of their long trauels) placed with wonderfull content vpon their priuate diuidents, and the planting [13] of particular Hundreds and Colonies pursued with an hopefull alacrity, all our projects (saith he) in a faire way, and their familarity with the Natiues, seeming to open a faire gate for their conuersion to Christianitie. The Country being in this estate, an occasion was ministred of sending to Opachankano the King of these Sauages, about the middle of March last, what time the Messenger returned backe with these words from him, That he held the peace concluded so firme, as the Skie should sooner fall then it dissolue: yea, such was the treacherous dissimulation of that people who then had contriued our destruction, that euen two dayes before the Massacre, some of our men were guided thorow the woods by them in safety: and one Browne, who then to learne the language liued among the Warra- scoyacks (a Prouince of that King) was in friendly manner sent backe by them to Captaine Hamor his Master, and many the like passages, rather increasing our former confidence, then any wise in the world ministring the least suspition of the breach of the peace, or of what instantly ensued; yea, they borrowed our owne Boates to conuey themselues crosse the Riuer (on the bankes of both sides whereof all our Plantations were) to consult of the diuellish murder that ensued, and of our vtter extirpation, which God of his mercy (by the meanes of some of themselues conuerted to Christianitie) preuented; and as well on the Friday morning (the fatal",

In which manner they also slew many of our people then at their seuerall workes and husbandries in the fields, and without their houses, some in planting Corne and Tobacco, some in gardening, some in making Bricke, building, sawing, and other kindes of husbandry, they well knowing in what places and quarters each of our men were, in regard of their daily familiarity, and resort to vs for trading and other negotiations, which the more willingly was by vs continued and cherished for the desire we had of effecting that great master-peece of workes, their conuersion. And by this meanes that fatall Friday morning, there fell vnder the bloudy and barbarous hands of that perfidious and inhumane people, contrary to all lawes of God and men, of Nature & Nations, three hundred forty seuen men, women, and children, most by their owne weapons; and not being content with taking away life alone, they fell after againe vpon the dead, making as well as they could, a fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and mangling the dead carkasses into many pieces, and carrying some parts away in derision, with base and bruitish triumph. Neither yet did these beasts spare those amongst [15] the rest well knowne vnto them, from whom they had daily receiued many benefits and fauours, but spitefully also massacred them, without remorse or pitty, being in this more fell then Lyons and Dragons, which (as Histories record) haue beene so farre from hurting, as they haue both acknowledged, and gratefully requited their Benefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell beasts, as to make them put off the very nature of beasts, and to put on humanity vpon them. But these miscreants, contrariwise in this kinde, put not off onely all humanity, but put on a worse and more then vnnaturall bruitishnesse.

He thought nothing too dear for them, and as being desirous to bind them unto him by his many courtesies, he never denied them anything that they asked him, insomuch that when these Savages complained unto him of the fierceness of our Mastiffs, most implacable and terrible unto them, (knowing them by instinct it seems, to be but treacherous and false-hearted friends to us, better than ourselves) he to gratify them in all things, for the winning of them by degrees, caused some of them to be killed in their presence, to the great displeasure of the owners, and would have had all the rest guelt (had he not been hindered) to make them the gentler and the milder to them. He was not only too kind and beneficial to the common sort, but also to their King, to whom he oft resorted, and gave many presents which he knew to be highly pleasing to him. And whereas this king before dwelt only in a cottage, or rather a den or hog-sty, made with a few poles and sticks, and covered with mats after their wild manner, to civilize him, he first built him a fair house according to the English fashion, in which he took such joy, especially in his lock and key, which he so admired, as locking and unlocking his door an hundred times a day, he thought no device in all the world was comparable to it. Thus insinuating himself to this King for his religious purposes, he conferred after with him oft, and intimated to him matters of our Religion; and thus far the Pagan confessed, moved by natural Principles, that our God was a good God, and better much than theirs, in that he had with so many good things above them endowed us. He told him, if he would serve our God, he should be partaker of all those good things we had, and of far greater than sense or reason ever could imagine. He won upon him, as he thought in many things, so as he gave him fair hearing and good answer, and seemed to be much pleased with his discourse and in his company.

One thing I cannot omit, that when this good Gentleman vpon his fatall hower, was warned by his man (who perceiued some treachery intended to them by these hell-hounds) to looke to himselfe, and withall ranne away for feare of the mischiefe he strongly apprehended, and so saued his owne life; yet his Master, out of the conscience of his owne good meaning, and faire deserts euer towards them, was so void of all suspition, and so full of confidence, that they had sooner killed him, then hee could or would beleeue they meant any ill against him. Thus the sinnes of these wicked Infidels, haue made them vnworthy of enioying him, and the eternall good that he most zealously alwayes intended to them.

Yet it pleased God to vse some of them as instruments to saue many of their liues, whose soules they had formerly saued, as at Iames-Citie, and other places, and the Pinnace trading in Pamounkey Riuer, all whose liues were saued by a conuerted Indian, disclosing the plot in the instant (whereof though our sinnes (say they) made vs vnworthy to be instruments of so glorious a conuersion in generall, yet his infinite wisedome can neuerthelesse bring it to passe [19] with some more of them, and with other Prouinces there in his good time, and by such meanes as wee thinke most vnlikely.

They certifie further, that besides Master George Thorpe, before mentioned, Master John Berkeley, Captaine Nathanael Powel, and his wife, (daughter of Master William Tracy, and great with childe) and Captaine Maycock, all Gentlemen of birth, vertue, and industry, and of the Councell there, suffered vnder this their cruelty and treason. That the slaughter had beene vniuersall, if God had not put it into the heart of an Indian belonging to one Perry, to disclose it, who liuing in the house of one Pace, was vrged by another Indian his Brother (who came the night before and lay with him) to kill Pace, (so commanded by their King as he declared) as hee would kill Perry: telling further that by such an houre in the morning a number would come from diuers places to finish the Execution, who failed not at the time: Perries Indian rose out of his bed and reueales it to Pace, that vsed him as a Sonne: And thus the rest of the Colony that had warning giuen them, by this meanes was saued. Such was (God bee thanked for it) the good fruit of an Infidell conuerted to Christianity; for though three hundred and more of ours [21] died by many of these Pagan Infidels, yet thousands of ours were saued by the means of one of them alone which was made a Christian; Blessed be God for euer, whose mercy endureth for euer; Blessed bee God whose mercy is aboue his iustice, and farre aboue all his workes: who wrought this deliuerance whereby their soules escaped euen as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowler.

And as Fame diuulgeth (not without probable grounds) their King hath since caused the most part of the Gunpowder by him surprized, to bee sowne, to draw therefrom the like increase, as of his Maize or Corne, in Haruest next. And that it is since discouered, that the last Summer Opachankano practised with a King of the Eastern shore (no well-willer of his) to furnish him with store of poison (naturally growing in his country) for our destruction, which he absolutely refused, though he sent him great store of Beades, and other presents to winne him thereunto: which he, with fiue or sixe of his great men, offered to be ready to iustifie against him. That the true cause [22] of this surprize was most by the instigation of the Deuill, (enemy to their saluation) and the dayly feare that possest them, that in time we by our growing continually vpon them, would dispossesse them of this Country, as they had beene formerly of the West Indies by the Spaniard; produced this bloody act. That neuer griefe and shame possessed any people more then themselues, to be thus butchered by so naked and cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presentment of a staffe in manner of a Peece, nor an vncharged Peece in the hands of a woman, from which they flye as so many Hares; much faster then from their tormenting Deuill, whom they worship for feare, though they acknowledge they loue him not. Thus haue you seene the particulars of this massacre, out of Letters from thence written, wherein treachery and cruelty haue done their worst to vs, or rather to themselues; for whose vnderstanding is so shallow, as not to perceiue that this must needs bee for the good of the Plantation after, and the losse of this blood to make the body more healthfull, as by these reasons may be manifest. First, Because betraying of innocency neuer rests vnpunished: And therefore Agesilaus, when his enemies (vpon whose oath of being faithfull hee rested) had deceiued him, he sent them thankes, for that by their periury, they had made God his friend, and their enemy. Secondly, Because our hands which before were tied with gentlenesse and faire vsage, are now set at liberty by the treacherous violence of the Sauages, [23] not vntying the Knot, but cutting it: So that we, who hitherto haue",
    "1842": "1622 557 had possession of no more ground then their waste, and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their owne contentment, gained; may now by right of Warre, and law of Nations, inuade the Country, and destroy them who sought to destroy vs: whereby wee shall enioy their cultiuated places, turning the laborious Mattocke into the victorious Sword (wherein there is more both ease, benefit, and glory) and possessing the fruits of others labours. Now their cleared grounds in all their villages (which are situate in the fruitfullest places of the land) shall be inhabited by us, whereas heretofore the grubbing of woods was the greatest labour. Thirdly, Because those commodities which the Indians enioyed as much or rather more than we, shall now also be entirely possessed by us. The Deere and other beasts will be in safety, and infinitely increase, which heretofore not only in the general huntings of the King (whereat foure or fiue hundred Deere were usually slaine) but by each particular Indian were destroyed at all times of the yeare, without any difference of Male, Damme, or Young. The like may be said of our owne Swine and Goats, whereof they haue used to kill eight in tenne more than the English haue done. There will be also a great increase of wild Turkies, and other waighty Fowle, for the Indians neuer put difference of destroying the Hen, but kill them whether in season or not, whether in breeding time, or sitting on their egges, or hauing new hatched, it is all one to them: whereby, as also by the orderly vsing of their fishing Weares, no knowne Country in [24] the world will so plentifully abound in victuall. Fourthly, Because the way of conquering them is much more easie then of ciuilizing them by faire meanes, for they are a rude, barbarous, and naked people, scattered in small companies, which are helps to Victorie, but hinderances to Ciuilitie: Besides that, a conquest may be of many, and at once; but ciuility is in particular, and slow, the effect of long time, and great industry. Moreouer, victorie of them may bee gained many waies; by force, by surprize, by famine in burning their Corne, by destroying and burning their Boats, Canoes, and Houses, by breaking their fishing Weares, by assailing them in their huntings, whereby they get the greatest part of their sustenance in Winter, by pursuing and chasing them with our horses, and blood-Hounds to draw after them, and Mastiues to teare them, which take this naked, tanned, deformed Sauages, for no other.",

By these and sundry other wayes, as by driuing them (when they flye) vpon their enemies, who are round about them, and by animating and abetting their enemies against them, may their ruine or subiection be soone effected. So the Spaniard made great vse for his owne turne of the quarrels and enmities that were amongst the Indians, as throughly vnderstanding and following that Maxime of the Politician, Diuidi & impera, Make diuisions and take Kingdomes: For thus he got two of the greatest Kingdomes of the West Indies, Peru and [25] Mexico, by the Princes diuisions, and the peoples differences. After the death of Guainacapa king of Peru, his sonnes Attabalippa and Gascar falling to war about the kingdom, & each of them striuing to make the Spaniard to his friend, Francis Pizzarro managing those their diuisions onely to his owne ends, easily stripped them both of that rich Kingdome, and became Master of Peru. And so likewise Ferdinando Cortez vanquished King Motezuma, and gained the Kingdome of Mexico from him, by the aid and furtherance of the neighboring people of the Prouince of Tascala, being deadly enemies to the Mexicans; for which seruice they of Tascala are freed by the Spaniards from all Tributes to this time. In VIRGINIA the many diuers Princes and people there are at this day opposite in infinite factions one vnto another, and many of them beare a mortall hatred to these our barbarous Sauages, that haue beene likely as false and perfidious heretofore to them, as vnto vs of late. So as the quarrels, and the causes of them, and the different humours of these people being well vnderstood, it will be an easie matter to ouerthrow those that now are, or may bee our enemies hereafter, by ayding and setting on their enemies against them. And by these factions and differences of petty Princes, the Romans tooke their greatest aduantage to ouercome this Iland of Great Britayne, of which Tacitus sayes, Ita dum singuli pugnant vniuersi vincuntur. And Justin hath the like saying of the cause of vanquishing the Grecian Cities. Fiftly, Because the Indians, who before were vsed as friends, may now most iustly be compelled to seruitude and drudgery, and supply the roome of men [26] that labour, whereby euen the meanest of the Plantation may imploy themselues more entirely in their Arts and Occupations, which",

Thus vpon this Anvile shall wee now beate out to our selues an armour of proofe, which shall for euer after defend vs from barbarous Incursions, and from greater dangers that otherwise might happen. And so we may truly say according to the French Prouerb, A quelque chose malheur est bon, Ill lucke is good for something. Lastly, We haue this benefit more to our comfort, because all good men doe now take much more care of vs then before, since the fault is on their sides, not on ours, who haue vsed so fayre a cariage, euen to our owne destruction. Especially his Maiesties most gratious, tender and paternall care is manifest herein, who by his Royall bounty and goodnesse, hath continued his many fauors vnto vs, with a new, large, & Princely supply of Munition and Armes, out of his Maiesties [27] owne store in the Tower, being gratiously bestowed for the safety and aduancement of the Plantation. As also his Royall fauor is amply extended in a large supply of men and other necessaries throughout the whole Kingdome, which are very shortly to bee sent to VIRGINIA. Neyther must wee omit the Honourable City of London, who to shew their zeale at this time (as they haue alwayes done vpon all Honourable occasions to their endlesse praise) are now setting forth one hundred persons, at their owne charges, for the aduancement of the Plantations. In the furtherance of which action, as the whole graue Senate of Aldermen haue shewed much piety and wisedome, so in particular, the Right Honourable Sir Edward Barkham Knight, the now Lord Mayor, hath demonstrated a most worthy mind.",
    "1845": "560 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nmind. Besides many worthy Persons of birth and quality, and divers others at their owne costs are now preparing for VIRGINIA. Neyther is any man to be deiected because of some such disasters as these that may seeme to thwart the businesse. What growing State was there euer in the world which had not the like? Rome grew by opposition, and rose vpon the backe of her enemies. Marke but the Spaniard who is in the same Continent with VIRGINIA, and hath now perfected his worke; Marke and tell mee, if hee hath not had more counterbuffes farre then wee, as out of their owne histories at large may be proued. Columbus vpon his returne from the West Indies into Spaine, hauing left his people with the Indian in peace, and promise of fayre vsage towards them, yet [28] at his comming backe againe, hee found no one man aliue of them, but all by the Natiues treacherously slaine. After this againe, when the Spanish Colony was increased in great numbers, the Indians (from whom the Spaniards for trucking stuffe vsed to haue all their corn) generally conspired together to plant no corne at all, intending therby to famish them, themselues liuing in the meane time vpon Cassaut (a root to make bread) onely then knowne to themselues: This plot of theirs by the Spaniards ouer-sight (that foolishly depended vpon Strangers for their bread) tooke such effect, and brought them to such misery by the rage of famine, that they spared no vncleane, no loathsome beast, no not the poysonous and hideous Serpents, but eate them vp also, deuouring one death to saue them from another: And by this meanes the whole Colony well-neare surfetted, sickned, and dyed miserably. After againe, vpon fresh and great supplyes new made, an infinite company of them by their incontinency dyed of the Indian disease, that hath now got a French name, which at first (as being a strange and vnknowne malady) was deadly vpon whomsoeuer it lighted. Besides (before they knew the cause and remedy) very many lost diuers parts of their body, feet and hands principally, by a little vermine lesse then a Flea, and skipping like it, called Nigua, which got between the skinne and the flesh before they were aware, and there bred and multiplyed, making swellings and putrefactions, to the decay and losse of their bodily members.",
    "1846": "What should I tell you that the Plantations diuers times were neare vndone, by the ambition, factions, and malice of the Commanders one vnto another. Columbus, to whom they were beholding for all, with his brothers, were sent home from the West Indies into Spaine bound with chaines: and some other great Commanders killed and murthered one another. Pizzarro was killed by Almagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded, which Vasco was taken by Blasco, and this Blasco was likewise taken by Pizzarroes brother. Thus by their owne spightfull and auaritious quarrels did they well-neare shake the mayne pillars of that Plantation. These and many other calamities and mischiefes, too long to relate now, hapned vnto them more then euer did to vs. And at one time their plantation was euen at the last gaspe, all their Colony being resolued desperately to leaue it, had not two ships vnexpected come in with new supplyes: yet wee see for all these miseries, that they haue attained to their ends at last, Honor, power, and wealth; In so much as that Countrey, which (when they were dishartned with disasters) they beganne to be so weary of, that they were about to forsake it all, in short time after (seeing all stormes blowne ouer, and fayre weather shining vpon them) they were so in loue with their great fortunes, that they grew so iealous of them, as made them shut them vp from the sight of any but themselues. And then they petitioned their King, by an inuiolable Decree to annexe and vnite the West Indies inseparably for euer to the Crowne of Spaine; which (for their better securitie and satisfaction) was accordingly performed and ratified, as it is to be seene in Hereras History of the West Indies. And whereas before, few could be hired to go to inhabite there, now with great suite they must obtaine it. Thus haue they in time by industry, patience, and constancy effected this great worke of theirs, notwithstanding to encrease their difficulties also, they were to deale with a most populous & numerous nation, which they ouercame at last: So as Oudedo in his third Booke of the first Part of his West Indie History saith, that of a million of Indians at least, that were in Hispaniola, there were not (in little more than forty yeares space after the first beginning of the Plantation) fiue hundred of them & all their children liuing: for the Indians that liued there, after were brought out of the Continent into that Island, or out of one Island to be planted in another.",
    "1847": "562 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nOn the other side, the Natiues in VIRGINIA are nothing populous, but thin and scattered Nations, as is knowne to all. Here by the way to make a little Digression, since I haue mentioned Ouiedo who liued aboue twenty two yeares in the West Indies, I will acquaint you with his obseruation and iudgement of the nature and disposition of the Indians there, that you may compare and see in what, and how farre, it agrees with that of the Natiues of VIRGINIA. They are (saith hee) by nature sloathfull and idle, vitious, melancholy, slouenly, of bad conditions, lyers, of small memory, of no constancy or trust. In another place he saith, The Indian is by nature of all people the most lying and most inconstant in the world, sottish and sodaine: neuer looking what dangers may happen afterwards, lesse capable then children of sixe [31] or seauen yeares old, and lesse apt and ingenious. This is the generall disposition of most of them, though there be some (sayes he) that be wise and subtill. And indeede it should seeme so, when they could ouerreach and goe beyond the Spaniard so much, to put that tricke of staruing them (as aforesaid) vpon them, to their so great and almost totall destruction. But to come againe to that which I first intended: Since the Spaniard (as we see) in his Plantations hath gone thorow farre more hazards, and greater difficulties then euer wee haue had, we therefore in looking to what is past, vpon great reason ought likewise not to be deterred, but so much the rather inuited to proceede with constancy and courage. And if besides wee looke (as most men doe) after the riches of a Countrey to inuite vs on, aske those that haue beene there, and haue trauelled farre and neare, and they will tell you, that no Countrey in the world doth naturally abound with more Commodities then VIRGINIA doth. The Clymate is knowne to be more temperate, and the soyle more rich then that of the West Indies is: neyther doth it want mynes of all sorts, no not of the richest, as is knowne to some now liuing, and shall be manifested when fit time shall serue. And yet to thinke that Gold and Siluer mynes are in a Countrey (otherwise most rich and fruitfull) the greatest wealth of a Plantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, That the Gold and Siluer is the greatest wealth of the West Indies now at this present time. True it is indeed, that in the first Conquest the Spaniards",
    "1848": "1622 563 got great and mighty treasure from the Indians, which they in long space had heaped up together, [82] and in those times the Indians shewed them entire and plentiful rich mines, which by length of time (as is well known and published to the world by those that have been there) are wasted and exhausted since, so as now the charge of getting those metals is grown most excessive, besides the consuming and spoiling many men of their lives, which are deprived of them by the vapors that come out of the Gold and Silver mines, which are most pestilent and deadly, as divers authors averre. Amongst others, a late Geographer speaking of the West Indies, and of those mines there, saith, Odor ex auri & argenti fodinis noxius admodum; neq; tamen prohibuit aeris corruptissimi violentia Hispanos, ne in alto orbe novum moriendi locum quaererent. So as all things considered by these mines, what by the lives of many men lost in them, and what with the great charge otherwise in getting them, the clear gain to the Adventurers from these metals (the Kings part defrayed) is but small to them, nothing near so much I am sure, as is imagined. And were it not for other rich Commodities there that enable and enrich the Adventurers, those of the Contractation house were never able to subsist by this. For the greatest part of their gain and profit I say consists not in these mines, but in their other Commodities, partly native, and partly translated from other parts of the world, and planted in the West Indies: As in their mighty wealth of Sugars (the Sugar-Canes being transported first from the Canaries,) and in Ginger, and some other commodities derived from the East Indies thither: in their Cochanile, their Indico, their Cotton, their infinite store of Hydes and Skins, [33] their Quick-silver, and Allom, Woad, and Brasillwood, &c. And their many other Dyes, Paints, Petacaraua, Tobacco, Gummes, Balmes, Oyles medicinall, and Perfumes, their Sarsaparillia, and many other physicall drugs, (for which, learned Physitians and skilfull Simplers were sent to take a survey, and make an exquisite draught of all the Plants in colours.) These I say and other the like commodities are the West Indies indeed unto the Adventurers, by which they are enabled to enrich themselves, and to sustain the mighty charge of drawing out the Gold and Silver, to the great and clear revenue of their King. I had many things of importance to say more, but I will detain the Reader no longer now. To conclude then, seeing that Virginia is most abundantly...",

Which though it doe manifestly proue the fruitfulnesse of the soile, yeelding all kinds of graine or plants committed vnto it, with a rich and plentifull encrease, yet cannot the fatnesse of the earth alone produce such excellent effects, vnlesse the temperature of the Ayre bee likewise so fauourable, that [46] those tender sprouts which the earth doth abundantly bring forth, may bee cherished with moderate heate and seasonable moisture, and freed both from scorching drought, and nipping frost.\n\nThese blessings are so much the more to bee esteemed, because they are bestowed vpon a place situated so conueniently, and at so good a distance both from Europe, and the West Indies, that for the mutuall commerce betwixt these great and most rich parts of the habitable world, there cannot bee deuised any place more conuenient for the succour and refreshing of those that trade from hence thither: whether they be of our owne nation, or of our neighbours and friends; the multitude of great and nauigable Riuers, and of safe and spacious harbours, as it were inuiting all Nations to entertaine mutuall friendship, and to participate of those blessings which God out of the abundance of his rich Treasures, hath so gratiously bestowed some vpon these parts of Europe, and others no lesse desired vpon those poore people: which might still haue remained in their old barbarous ignorance, without knowledge of their owne misery, or of Gods infinite goodnesse and mercy; if it had not pleased God thus gratiously both to draw vs thither with desire of such wealth as those fruitfull Countries afford, and also to grant vs so easie, certaine, and safe a meanes to goe vnto them: which passage is in mine opinion made much more secure",
    "1858": "1622 573 and easie by the commodious harbours and refreshing which VIRGINIA doth reach out vnto vs. The coasts of Florida to the West, being not so harborous; and of New England to the East, somewhat more out of the way, amongst so many [47] Flats and small Islands not so safe. Neither is the commodiousnesse of VIRGINIAS situation onely in respect of this west Atlanticke Ocean, but also in respect of the Indian Ocean, which wee commonly call the South Sea, which lyeth on the West and North west side of VIRGINIA, on the other side of the Mountains beyond our Fals, and openeth a free and faire passage, not onely to China, Japan, and the Moluccas; but also to New Spaine, Peru, Chila, and those rich Countries of Terra Australis, not as yet fully discouered. For the Sea wherein Master Hudson did winter, which was first discouered by him, and is therefore now called Mare Hudson, doth stretch so farre towards the west, that it lieth as farre westward as the Cape of Florida: So that from the Fals aboue Henrico City, if we shape our iourney towards the Northwest following the Rivers towards the head, we shall vndoubtedly come to the Mountaines, which as they send diuers great Riuers Southward into our Bay of Chesepiock, so likewise doe they send others from their further side Northwestward into that Bay where Hudson did winter. For so wee see in our owne Country, from the ridge of Mountaines continued from Derbishire into Scotland, doe issue many great Riuers on both sides into the East Germane Ocean, and into the Westerne Irish Seas: in like sort from the Alpes of Switzerland and the Grizons, do runne the Danubie Eastward into Pontus Euxinus, the Rhene into the North Germane Ocean, the Rhosne west into the Mediterrane Sea, and the Po South into the Adriatike Sea. This Bay where Hudson did winter, stretcheth it selfe Southward into 49. degrees, and cannot be in probability so farre distant from the Fals as 200. Leagues; part of the way lying by the Riuers side towards the mountaines from whence it springeth: and the other part on the other side cannot want Riuers likewise, which will conduct vs all the way, and I hope carry vs and our prouisions a good part of it. Besides that Bay, it is not vnlikely that the Westerne Sea in some other Creeke or Riuer commeth much neerer then that place: For the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter, lying more Westerly then Master Hudsons Bay by 190. Leagues in the same Sea, doth extend it selfe very neere as farre towards the west as the Cape of California, which is now found to be an Iland stretching it selfe from 22. degrees to 42. 1982-3338",

Which relations are cunningly set downe by some vpon set purpose to put vs out of the right way, and to discourage such as otherwise might bee desirous to search a passage by the way aforesaid into those Seas. Gerardus Mercator, a very industrious and excellent Geographer, was abused by a Map sent vnto him, of foure Huripi meeting about the North Pole; which [49] now are found to be all turned into a maine Sea. One demonstration of the crafty falshood of these vsuall Maps is this, that Cape Mendocino is set in them West Northwest, distant from the South Cape of California, about seuenteene hundred Leagues, whereas Francis Gaule that was imployed in those discoueries by the Viceroy of New Spaine; doth in Hugo Linscotten his booke set downe their distance to bee onely fiue hundred Leagues. Besides this, in the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter in 57. degrees of latitude, the constant great tides euery twelue houres, and the increase of those tides whensoeuer any strong westerne wind did blow, doe strongly perswade vs that the maine Westerne Ocean is not farre from thence; which was much confirmed vnto them the Summer following; when sayling directly North from that place where they wintered, about the Latitude of 60. degrees, they were crossed by a strong Currant running sometimes Eastward, sometimes Westward: So that if wee finde either Hudsons Bay, or any Sea more neere vnto the West, wee may assure our selues that from thence wee may with great ease passe to any part of the East Indies: And that as the world is very much beholding to that famous Columbus for that hee first discouered vnto us the West Indies; and to the Portingall for the finding out the ordinary and as yet the best way that is knowne to the East Indies, by Cape Bona-Speranza.

In regard also whereof, the Captain is to be tied to proceed with advise of the Governor & Counseil there; & so shall you be secure both from abuse & blame. God prosper the busines.",
