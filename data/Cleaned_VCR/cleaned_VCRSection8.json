Wee vnderstand that Mr. Pountis his care & charitie in the providing for the Maide hath been very abundant, for which not onely the particular Adventurers, who haue sent him a remembrance of their loues, but the whole Company returne him verie hartie thankes: But whereas we are informed by some private letters, of his purpose to come to England this yeare, if it be not grounded on waightier reasons then are alledged we earnestly intreate him to stay considering both in regard of his skill and office, there will be speciall need of his assistance in the building of the forte and otherwise: In this request the Adventurers of Southampton hundred ioyne, who by the good entrance that he hath made in their bussines haue conceived much hope of the bettering their Plantation; and for the ordering of the Discoverie, and the proceed of her voyage which hath been a Marveilous charge vnto them, they do much relie vppon his help. The reward of the great paines and care which we and they by the severall employments haue putt vppon him, shalbe to the vttermost of their powers abillities and we doubt not to his full content; for the performance whereof we desire creditt onely till the arivall of the Abigaile. One thinge more in particular we are to intreat him: that whereas there haue been a deliuery of certaine kine and Calues, vnto him by Mr. Woodall's appointm' that he do not proceed in the sale or disposinge of any more of them then are already sold, till they haue further order from the Company, who conceiue themselues much wronged in the deliuery of so many, beside that there is claime made by others vnto that debt vppon which Mr. Woodall had the order for the Cattle.

There comes also along one Leonard Hudson a Carpenter with his wife and fiue of our Apprentices for the erecting of the East India Schoole, the monies would not reach vnto the sending of an Usher as was first intended; and besides vppon a second consideration, it was thought good to giue the Collony the choise of the Schoolemaster; or Usher, if so be there be any there fitt for the place, if not, we desire to vnderstand what proportion of maintenance they will alowe and accordingly, wee will do our best, to procure from hence an honest, and sufficient man for such a charge. The building of a Schoole and setting out the land at Charles Cittie is not so absolutely required, but that if another place shalbe iudged more convenient by the Colonie, it is lefte to your choise; but that there be such a proportion of land some where laid out, and that those people now sent be kept together for cultivating the land and building of a house; may not vppon any reason whatsoever be altered: wherefore wee pray you to lett the buissines proceed in that course, where in the notice of a good beginning, we are assured will stirr vpp the mind of diuers good people to add liberally to this foundation: There is very much in this buissines that wee must leave to your cares and wisdomes; and the help and assistance of good people, of which we doubt not.",

Mr. Robert Paulett the Minister, was he whom the Court chose to be of the Counsell, for Mr. Harwood the Adventurers of Martins hundred desire that he might be spared from that office, their bussines requiring his presence continually.

And for as much as Our seruant, Iohn Bonoeil hath taken paines in setting downe the true vse of the Silkeworme, together with the Art of Silkemaking, and of planting Vines, and that his experience and abilities may much conduce to the aduancement of this busines; We doe hereby likewise require you to cause his directions, both for the said Silkeworkes and Vineyards, to bee carefully put in practice thorowout our Plantations there, that so the worke may goe on cheerfully, and receiue no more interruptions nor delayes.\n\nGiuen vnder Our Signet, at our Palace of Westminster, the ninth day of Iuly, in the twentieth yeere of our Raigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the fiue and fiftieth.\n\nTo Our right trusty and right welbeloued Cousin and Councellour, HENRY, Earle of South-hampton, Treasurer of our Plantation in Virginia, and to Our trusty and welbeloued, the Deputy, and others of Our said Plantation.\n\nVirginia.\n\nWINDEBANK.",

This disposition of mind, we assure ourselves you shall find, if not, you must make it, and compel them to their own good, that will not otherwise understand it, but we hope there shall be no such occasion given, considering the marvelous forwardness of the Colony in this kind by many letters expressed: the remembrance whereof brings to mind the noble offer made by Sr. George Yeardley, worthy...",

    "1994": "706 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nHoly writt sayeth That God would not that the Children of Israell, though they were of farr greater number, then wee are yet in many ages like to be, and came into a Countrie where were walled townes, not to vtterly destroy the heathen, least the woodes and wilde beasts should ouer runn them. My owne observation hath bene such as assureth me that if the Indians inhabitt not amongst vs vnder obedience, and as they haue ever kept downe the woods and slayne the wolues, beares, and other beasts, (wch are in greate number) we shalbe more opressed in short tyme by their absence, then in their liueing by vs both for our owne securitie as also for our Cattle. They by experi- ence, when as by the meanes before spoken of, they shalbe brought into subiection and shalbe made to deliuer hostages for their obediance, there is no doubt by Gods grace but of the saueinge of many of their soules. And beinge natiues are apter for worke then yet our English are, knowing howe to attayne greate quantitie of silke, hempe, and flax, and most exquisite in the dressinge thereof for our vses, fitt for guides vppon discouery into other Countries adiacent to ours, fitt to rowe in Gallies & friggetts, and many other pregnant vses too tedious to sett downe.\n\nFirst, that none of what ranke soeuer doe euer drinke or trade with in the late precinct of Opichankanoe nor any borderinge neighbours. Nowe for avoydinge future danger in our Collonye, that ayded him in this last disaster. Secondly, for our owne people to sett & sowe a sufficient proportion of corne for their owne vses, and yearely to lay vpp into a granary a proportion for wch if they haue noe vse for them selues the next yeare, then to be sould and euery man to haue his dewe payd him.",
    "1995": "DECEMBER 16, 1622\n\nMy reason for the first is yt by this meanes the Savages shalbe frustrated of all meanes of buyinge any manner of victualls, and clothinge, but what they shall haue from vs for their labor and industrie. As alsoe beinge disabled from hireinge anye Auxiliaries if at any tyme they would rebell, Opichankanoe to hyer. For the second howe benifitiall the settinge and sowinge of Corne and layinge vpp thereof for store, will luculently appeare by their nowe want being disturbed by theis Savages at this tyme, And likewise other vnexpected accedents may happen both by forrayne and domesticke enymies hereafter. Two Storehowses or Granaries to be erected and placed for this purpose fittest for saftie, and then for Conventence wch I will leaue to demonstrate to yo' [honor] vntill yo' Come to the Mapp of the Countrie.

    "2061": "Preface\n\nThe records of the Virginia Company during the first three months of the years from January, 1622/23 to January, 1624/25, picture the final attempts to regulate and develop the tobacco trade with Virginia. Then follow papers revealing the bitter attack upon the Earl of Southampton and the adventurers associated with him, by Sir Nathaniel Rich and the defenders of Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s regime. Throughout the whole period are portrayed the struggle of the plantation to recover from the Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, and the efforts made by the officials in London and by the Governor, Council, and Assembly in Virginia.\n\nThe most important and perhaps unique document of the entire series published in volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia Company is the Records of Proceedings upon Information of Quo Warranto in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, found by the editor in the Public Record Office, London. It, alone, covers one hundred pages of volume IV. The largest number of documents come from the Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III. Like volumes I and II, comprising the minutes of the London company, it is deposited in the Library of Congress, Washington, District of Columbia. In it are spread the official papers of the Governor, Council and Assembly of Virginia. They include letters to and from the officers of the Virginia Company of London, commissions issued, orders declared, petitions granted, warrants for elections, statements of the condition of the colony and other documents revealing the history of the plantation.\n\nA long series of papers shedding much light on the terrific conflict within the Company, resulting in its dissolution by Quo Warranto proceedings, comes from the Manchester Papers, now in the Public Record Office, London, being largely letters and memoranda of Sir Nathaniel Rich.\n\nThe Colonial Office Papers in the Public Record Office, the Ferrar Papers, and the Papers of Lord Sackville, now deposited at Knole Park, Kent, each supplied a number of important documents.\n\nIn this volume, then, is to be found the record of the dissension within the company that brought about the close of the corporation and the end of the first period of the colony\u2019s history. At the same time the beginning of Virginia as a crown colony is set forth. Here also is portrayed the settled life of the plantation. Much is told of the colonists and their efforts to create an organized and systematic government, to produce commodities that would provide the necessities for living, and to develop resources that might result in needful trade with the Indians and with England.",
    "2062": "Two documents of importance, inadvertently omitted at first, but now numbered CCOXLYV A and CDANXAVULA, will be found, not in their chronological place, but at the end of the volume, as Addenda. The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Dr. Hubert Hall for his labors in supervising the transcript of the Quo Warranto Proceedings and in translating the entire document. As in the previous volume, the editor is deeply indebted to Professor A. Franklin Animeson for his continued care in seeing the document through the press; to Marian Corter Anderson for her assistance in preparing the manuscript for the press and in the difficulties of reading the proof. Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index for this volume as she did for Volume III, and to her again the editor wishes to express appreciation of her contribution. A part of the expense of arranging the manuscript, reading the proof, and making the index was met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council. December 1, 1934. Susan M. Kingsbury. vi",

Manchester Papers, No. 311 Document in Public Record Office, London, Autograph of Edward Collingwood (?) List of Records No. 396 A comparison of the former estates of the Companies for their Tobacco, with what it is now by this Contract. First in the year 1619 there came near upon 70000: weight of Tobacco from the Summer Islands: great quantities whereof were sold for twelve pence the pound, and generally 2s the pound was the highest price that it was sold at. There came the end of that year; and the beginning of the year 1620 for the Account of the Magazine for Virginia about 26000; weight: whereof about 20000: weight was bought by Alderman Johnson and his partners for less than 2s 3d a pound: and generally one with another the Tobaccos returned from Virginia that year were not sold for 2s a pound or not above. So that the estate of the Companies was that indeed except some Retailers, there was not generally made above 2s a pound towards all Charge. And this price was likely to decay every year as greater abundance of Tobacco came in: whereupon in the year 1620 in March, there was a Charter sent to the Colonie in Virginia from the Company here, wherein they directly declared unto them, that they should not expect more than twelve pence a pound in Virginia. [Endorsement is in a modern hand.]",

As for the Deuty Boyes, they think much to be brought to a backe reckoning: since they paid as much as was demaunded for them & received acquitances. Yet Sir George Yardly will pay the overplus for those which he reserved to himselfe: the like offer was made by Capt.

By this meanes the king's proffitt is highlie increased, his interest likewise deeply interessed to regard the prosperity of these Plantations that afford him so great a yearelie proffit. The good and benefit of arising to the owners &c. is the Plantations secured & satisfied, else they would soon come to nothing by the abundance of Tobacco now planted in Brasill & the W. Indies which in 3 or 4 yeares will eat out all the king's proffitt and the proffitt of the Plantations by bringing it to that cheapnes that it will not be worth 4d per pound to be sould if some speedy course be not taken to prevent it. Also likewise this is a secure course against private stealing in of Tobacco for if none but those such as are licensed may sell, every Retayler will be an Informer, and there will be none that will adventure to buy but the Retaylors themselves who shall not buy of any other but to their owne hinderance at least not any great quantity. Neither shall his Mat need to forbid the Importation of Spanish Tobacco but sett a good Custom upon it. And if the king's Merchants will buy it they may and that they may make profit by it they may: which they will not doe if they see it will be any hinderance to the venting of the Plantation Tobacco. Lastly as it is good for his Mat's benefit and good & necessary for the subsisting of the Plantations: so it is not prejudicial to any but only to regulate the dispersal of it without forbidding importation of foreign Tobacco, to the offence of any of his mat's Allyes so is it good for this kingdom if the last price be ordered at the utmost not to exceed 9d in the pound whereas now by retayle of small the Subject payes ordinarilie a third part more. And in truth is hurtfull to none but And it being a superfluous comodity it cannot by any discreet or indifferent man but be thought a matter of high prudence in his Mat thus to order a superfluity to so good just and honorable end.

For His Majesty should not only lose the strongest fort of Christendom, and place of singular importance to fasten his alliance with the King of Spain in respect of their Neighborhood to the West Indies, but if they should revolt to the Pirates they would as well infest his Majesty as his Allies: strength advance the strength of the Pirates and make them a fierce foe to the destruction of merchant and Merchandize which is at a low ebb already and so weak, that now a little addition of discouragement to what they had before would utterly decay trade. And lastly even to the plantation of Virginia the revolt of these Islands would give a deadly and a fatal blow: Therefore special regard should be had to give contentment to these Islands: which cannot vent as well or better than here nor Imposition at all for if during that time the commodities they raise may offer when they paid no custom time they could not subsist without.",

[Indorsed:] The business of Tobacco with the Virginia and Somer Islands Company, CCLNNNINX. Answer To THE Forecoming Propositions | March (?), 1623 Papers of Lord Sackville, No. 6167 Document at Knole Park, Kent An Aunsweare to the Propositions exhibited to the Right Hon'ble the Lord High Treasurer of England for the equall managing of the Contract with his Majestie concerning the sole Importation of Tobacco etc. It is first to be observed, that the Contract hath been ratified by Six Quarter Courts; viz. three of each Companie: noe one man at the question declaring his dissent, save only the Deputy, and that in the first Court only. It is also to be observed that the Raisers of troubles in the Courts namely Mr. Wrote and his abettors, though their pretences have been against the Salaries and the manner of Importation of Spanish Tobacco: yet in the heat of their oppositions, their speeches and reasons have always reflected upon the body of the Contract itselfe, which being contrarie to all order hath much distasted the Companies. And it is nowe to be observed that these Propounders though their pretence in their writing be for the equall managing of the Contract, And although they have often in the courts very solemnly protested and vowed, that they were not against the Contract itselfe, yet when they came before the Lord Treasurer, they dismasked themselves, and unanimously professed that they were against the very body of the contract: which sheweth, that these Articles can be noe other than Cavills, seeing their pretence is one way, and their intent another way. And before wee come to the answering of the particular Articles, wee are inforced to take exceptions unto the manner of propounding them. From the text printed in the American Historical Review, XXVII. pp. 750-762.",
    "2107": "MARCH (?), 123 33 For it is necessarie to be knowne, that the Counsell, Committees and Companies having first concluded on the Offices necessarie for the menaging of this Contract, as also of their rewardes by way of Sallarie (according to the fift Article of the Contract): The Officers themselves were lastly chosen in both the Courts: and the burthen was imposed upon the chiefe of them, in a free and unanimous eleccion, contrary to their most earnest and often iterated desires. It is also further to be knowne, that by reason of these troubles, both the chiefe Officers and divers of the Committees having voluntarily surrendred their places, and greatly importuned the Courts, to accept of their Surrenders; yet the same have beene refused, and they continued in their offices, much contrary to their wills, and most earnest suits, whereas contrariwise these Articles are propounded in that manner, as though the Officers had bin ambitious of this imployment, and consequently were to undertake it with all indignities. Then which nothing can be more untrue and unjust. 1. To the first Article it is answered, that the matter therein conteyned is allready regulated in the Quarter Courts of bothe the Companies. And that the Officers or Agents of the companies have noe more to doe in the bringing in of the Varinaes Tobacco, then any other perticuler member that liste to adventure his stock therein: By which order of the said Quarter Courts, it is declared that the perticuler Adventurers for the said Varinaes Tobacco are to bring in the proporcion expressed by the Contract: the Bodies of the Companies bearing a tenth part with them. But in case of any misfortune by losse of their Tobacco without the default of the said Adventurers, they are not to be farther charged also with restitucion or recompence: but the same is to rest upon the whole body of the Companies, and consequently to be answered out of the Companies publique Stocks: and if these should not suffice, then out of the stocks of the Generall Adventurers returned from the Plantations, as heretofore in like cases had beene usually done. 2. In the second Article, the Question is likewise resolved by bothe the Quarter Courts; vizt. that generally the Adventurers and Planters, both for price and payment, are to goe in equall lines: Neither of which are to be ordered or concluded by the officers, but by the Generall Courts them-",
    "2108": "34 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nselves; the matter being first seriously debated and prepared by the Committees. And in favour of the poorer sorte of Planters, there have beene divers other wayes devised and resolved upon, by the generall consent of bothe the Courts; both for the advancing of their prices, and expediting of their payments.\n\n3. To the third Article it is answered, that it is grounded wholy upon errors. An error it is, to conceave that the rating of charges, is in the power of the Officers: being reserved (as all other important matters) to the Generall Courts. An error it is, to thinke, that the labour of the Officers, consisteth wholy or chiefly in the matter of Sale: the well managing of the Contract extending itselfe in the difficulties thereof to a much larger Compasse. And lastly it is an error and misinformacion, to say that the Salaries amount unto five and twenty hundred poundes: whereas they come but to Seaventeene hundred poundes. But to the matter itselfe of this article, the answere is not difficult. For the charges to be imposed wilbe lighter or heavier according to the proporcion greater or lesser of Tobacco to be brought in, and that with this comfort both to Adventurers and Planters that the greatnes of the quantity will diminishe the perticuler charge; and the smallnes of the quantity will enhance the generall price.\n\nBut whereas there is mencion made of the selling the Tobacco together, it is to be observed that the course thereof lately propounded, by these Objectors, is subject to Fraude and much wrong both to the Kinge and Companies: vizt. that certaine Undertakers, being members of the Companies, should rayse a greate Stock in money, to buy of all the Tobacco by way of whole Sale. For considering the courts in the vacacions are often times very thinne, and the Somer Landes Court by the Letters Pattents may consiste of Highte persons onely: these Undertakers may easily attayne to be the greater parte of the Courts, and consequently may be both Buyers and Sellers at the same time. A feare not causeles, but grounded on former experience; whereby some of these Objectors have made themselves rich, by the great losse and detriment of the Adventurers and Companies.",
    "2109": "MARCH 5, 1623\n\nTo the 4th Article the answere is, that the Court have allready ordered that the Custome and freight shalbe discharged by the Officers, who are to be secured from damage by the goodes in their custody.\n\n5. To the 5 article it is likewise answered that the Courts with General consent (onely one dissenting) have taken full order for security both of goodes and money: which orders have beene read before the Lord Treasurer, and wee suppose they are more exquisite for caution on all sides, then are used in anie other Company whatsoever, as at the making of them was openly acknowledged. The particularities whereof are too long to be here sett downe: but are ready to be shewen to any that shall desire to see them. Whereunto wee may add a strict oath, which is to be administred to all the Officers of what degree soever, for just and equall dealing, both in keeping, preserving, selling and accompting for the goodes; as also in making the payments at such time as they shall growe due wherein the Officers also from time to time are to be directed by the Courts.\n\n6. To the Sixte Article, it is answered, that by vertue of the Contract, the Proclamation mentioned was presently to come forth. But upon motion from the Lord Treasurer, the Companies have consented, that it may be forborne till the Twentieth of June: at which time the Lord Treasurer hath promised that it shalbe published. Of the performance of whose promise, though the Propounder here seeme to make soe great doubt; yet the Companies will make none at all: and therefore hold it unfitt to follow the Propounders steps any further; in which it seemeth that jealousy hath outrun their duety.\n\n7. To the Seaventh it is answered that the Officers are to be accountable for all charges, if five and twenty hundreth poundes will serve, the remayne is to be restored. If more be necessary, that which wants must agayne be leavied. That the Officers out of their owne estates, should beare those uncertaine burthens, of desperate debts, suits in lawe, shrinkage and the like, is soe farr not onely from Equitie, but from all ordinarie reason, that they hope the Propounders themselves upon better consideration will retract the Question.",
    "2110": "36. RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nS. To the Eighth Article it is answered, that the case of meane Tobacco is much more difficult without this Contract, than with or under it. For the Twelve pence on the pound amounted to much more than the value of one entire halfe, not only of the meaner, but also of the middle sort thereof as experience hath shewed.\n\n9. To the Ninth Article, which layeth aspersions on the Officers\u2019 persons, the Answere is plaine. The two chiefe Officers were chosen by the Ballating box with 63 votes for them, and not above five against them. The Eight Committees were chosen by erection of hands out of the number of Sixteen, named by the Courts to stand for the places: In which number of Sixteen, were divers of these objectors. The Companies made choice of them whom by experience they knew to love the Plantations, and were fitt for the diversity of employments incident to this busines: some of them being Merchants, some Retailors, some skillfull in the Portes, and others such as by long continuance and attendance in the Courts, were skillfull in the affaires of the Companies and Plantations and withall large Adventurers. Of which Eight, six have beene yearely chosen Committees and Assistants for these Three yeares last past; neither any just exception can be taken to any of them by mindes unpossessed with partiality or malice, neither are the companies to be blamed in this or other their elections, if they have rather made choice to entrust their Goodes in the hands of men untainted for integritie and honesty, than in theirs, whose wisdome hath beene for their owne particular benefitt, who in their former managements of Tobacco have reduced Seaven thousand poundes sterling to Fower thousand poundes, and who never yet gave up any faire account of the Companie\u2019s goodes.\n\n[Indorsed:] Aunsweare to certen Propositions exhibited to the Lord Treasuror concerning the Contract.",

The Quantity of Tobacco (by reason of the late excessive planting thereof in the West Indies and in the new Plantations of Guiana and Brasil) is like to be so great that all these parts of Christendom will be glutted with it, and the price of Tobacco brought so low that in probability it will not be worth so much a pound as His Matie hath now for Custom.\n\n2. The Tobacco of those Countries, though not in wholesomeness yet in strength and taste and estimation doth so far excel ours of the English Plantations that if in His Maties dominions we cannot find sale for it, our Tobacco will yield nothing at all.\n\n1 Another copy is No. 6178 of Lord Sackville\u2019s manuscripts at Knole Park, and is printed under the heading \"Proposals of Sir Nathaniel Rich,\" in the American Historical Review, XXVIII pp. 752-754.\n\n2 In the hand of Sir Nathaniel Rich.",
    "2124": "50 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nTherefore for the setling and advancement both of His Maties yearelie Revenue and the good of the Plantations in Virginia and the Sommer Islands (which are amongst many others most memorable works of His Ma happie government) It is propounded That as the French King hath the Gabel of salt in France: and the King of Spaine the sole Merchandize both of Pepper and even of this particular commodity of Tobacco in Spayne: So it would please his most Excellent Matie our Soveraigne to take the sole preemption of all the Tobacco of the English Plantations in Virginia and the Sommer Islands: allowing the Adventurers and Planters within some convenient tyme after they shall deliver it at the Port of London 2s a pound for the worser sort (so that it be merchantable) 2s 6d for the middle sort, and 3s a pound for the best: cleare of charge of fraight, Custome and Impost: onely the Adventurers and Planters to beare the charge of transportation. This will give full and universall content to the Planters and Adventurers, who must needs acknowledge it a worke of great grace and princely wisedom in his Matie so to provide for them that they shalbe in better case then ever they were.\n\nAnd for securing His Ma's yearelie profit it may be managed that some able men may be conferred withall who will become the King's Merchants for this Commodity and allow his Matie double the proportion which his Matie payes them for this Tobacco: so that the quantitie thereof exceed not 400 thousand weight, which is as much as the Plantations will be able to supply for his Matie. Thus will His Matie's Revenue by this Commodity be raised to fortie if not fiftie thousand pounds per annum certaine and his Matie not one penny out of purse: And for encouragement of these Merchants it is propounded that they may have the sole power to licence the Retailing of this commodity: And then for their owne securitie they may agree with a convenient number in every Citie, Towne, and greatest parish to buy from off their hands yearely a proportion of this Tobacco, at such Rates as the said Merchants may be reasonable gainers, and such quantities as the merchants shalbe sure to have the whole commodity taken from them and dispersed into many hands, and this is very feasible for if none may sell or retaile Tobacco but such as shalbe licensed by the King's merchants they will find rather too many than too few that will in this kind deale with them.",

The excessive stealing in of forreyn Tobacco into this Kingdom wilbe thereby auoyded and the charge of strict search for it in the Portes saued, for euery Retailer will in his case be an Informer because it will hinder both his owne and his fellowes proffitt: And for their better incouragement they may haue the Moytie of all such Tobacco as they shall discouer to be brought in and acquired by fraud in any other sort then as is formerlie propounded.\n\n5.

O. 1, Vol. III, No. 10 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 424\n\nSundry Reasons against the Contract and Joynt stocke for the Virginia and summer Islands Tobacco.\n\n1. The Contract besides Custome and charges is to yeald his mat\u2019 one third part of the goods in kind, wch third part (by reason the Condition of this yeares Tobacco falles out to bee meane and little worth) will disappoint his ma\u2018 in point of profit. And the other two thirds being of like bad Condition (all charges deducted) there wilbee little or nothing remayneing for the Adventurers and Planters.\n\n2. The greate quantitie and meane Condition of the Virginia and summer Islands Tobacco is such as for the most parte it must bee exported at easie rates into Turkie, Barbarie, and other forreine parts. Which by the charge of this Contract is impossible without great damage and losse to the owners.\n\n3. The heauie charge laid vpon Tobacco by this Contract will occasion the transportacon thereof from the Plantations into forreine parts and not into Englande, whereby his ma\"* wilbe a great looser and the Companie much damnified. Nay it is to bee feared that the people in the summer Islands will growe altogeather idle haueing nothing else to raise profit by and then povertie and want may driue them to revolte and so his mat* loose the strongest knowne forte in the Christiandome world tending both to the safetie of this kingdome and acquisition of that other of Virginia to the wch it serues instead of an impregnable forte.\n\n1 The date given in Sainsbury is March 20, 1623/4.

    "2128": "54 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\n4. No such Contract as this can bee made but by the Joynt Consent of all the Adventurers and Planters whereof not one of ten haue giuen their [2] Consent and manie of those that consented conceiued themselues inforced vnto it but being since better acquainted with his ma'ties most free and gracious intention doe now humblie declare their disassent therevnto conceiuing that this Contract cannot be proceeded in without extreame Injustice and forfeiture of our Charters by wch wee are to governe our affaires according to the Lawes of England that doe not allow the good subiect to bee dispossessed of his goods without his Consent. And wee doe humblie pray that the Act of a fewe and such as are least interessed in point of charge, and therefore doe not feele the waight of the burthen wch they lay vpon other men may not preiudice the whole Companie.\n\n5. The rate for exporting of people to the Plantation was wont to bee fiue or sixe pound a head to bee paid in Tobacco but by this Contract the rate will growe to bee ten or twelue pound at least; the owners forecasting that the Tobacco wch they shall take for freight of the Passengers wilbee more then twice dearer vnto them then in former times. And soe by that meanes will extreamelie hinder the Peopleing of the Plantations when passengers cannot but at such extreame rates bee transported thither.\n\n6. The sole importation of Spanish Tobacco is a part and cheife Consideration of this Contract by which importation not the Companies but priuate men that make the stocke shall receiue the benefit; And therefore [3] noe cause why in that respect the goods of the Adventurers and Planters should bee charged by this contracte.\n\n7. It is a thing of great daunger and hazard for particuler mens estates to bee ingaged to his Ma'tie by the seales of the Companie for the performance of so great a Contract wch may breede questions and lie as a perpetuall charge and Incumbrance vpon the persons goods and lands of them and their heyres that are free of the said Companies yea although they neuer receiued one pennie benefit by their freedome.\n\n8. A single Planter doth raise at the most but 380 pound weight of Tobacco in the Summer Islands in one yeare for his owne part whereof one third by the Contract is to goe to his ma'tie, an ordinarie charge besides Salary, and so rests scarce ten pound weight to the poore.",
    "2129": "MARCH 20, 1622/3\n\nLabourer not worth in all above one pound five shillings for his whole years paines and even out of this 25s being the labour of the whole year he is by the Contract to allow double salarie which may take away all the rest and leave him nothing at all; And the Adventurers are in the same case so as apparently the plantation will be overthrown if this Contract do proceed. Neither will the monopolizing of Tobacco into one hand any ways better this bargain but rather make it worse for\n\n1. If by that means they suppose to raise the price and to sell it dearer that will be the next way to cause such an importation by stealth (as was seen in pepper when the like course was taken) as that our Tobacco will lie unvented till it rot and perish, and the charge of keeping the Port to prevent it will be in likelihood more than the goods are worth.\n\n2. It were a dangerous precedent and never heard of that plurality of voices should conclude the goods of other men without their Consent to be put into a Joint stock at the coming home of the ship whereas the Adventure outward was by particular men not in Joint stock which if it shall be admitted to take place will be the utter ruin and destruction of all trade and Commerce.\n\n3. It occasions a strange charge of a yearly stipend or salary to Officers to manage this Joint stock which the Companies are not able to bear and yet by votes of such as are least interested and of those men themselves who are to receive it, was carried by plurality of voices.\n\n4. By this means his majesty will be charged with 8 or 960\u00a3 per Ann certain for his third part of this salary and how much more we know not so that perhaps his majesty's charge will be more than his whole third part of this mean Tobacco will come unto.\n\n5. It hinders the poor people from trucking away their Tobacco for Commodities by which heretofore they have relieved themselves and made a greater benefit than ever they could do by selling for ready money.\n\n6. It bereaves both Planters and Owners of present means to supply their shares seeing they must attend the sale and Account of the Joint stock. It subjects them to great hazard by ill debts.",

It involves them in intricate Accompts and is like to occasion infinite suite and Contentions and will breed much confusion in the sale of their goods for in this Commodity one man's parcell of Tobacco is much better than another and either it must be sold with theirs of less value and so a loss to the Owner and general discouragement to make their Tobacco good or else if every man's be kept apart we must rest [5] upon the good will of the Agents when this or that man's parcell shall be sold.\n\n9. The experience of the losses and inconveniences which have grown by all other Joint stocks is sufficient to deter men from this course and we hope his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 will not permit that any man shall be forced to it whether he will or no. We conceive this business will be better managed if it will please his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 to limit the Importation of Spanish Tobacco to a reasonable proportion as already he hath done and to grant the farm thereof to whom his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 shall please for his own best benefit.

Letter To Sir SAMUEL SANDYS March 30, 1623 Manchester Papers, No. 320 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 429\n\nSir,\n\nI humblie crave your pardon if I have not written unto you so often as you expected, and my dutie bound me: presuming that the Governour had acquainted you with whatsoever was worthie your knowledge. We found at our coming over the Country in peace, but in such a peace as presaged ruine: the people dispersed in small families, farre distant one from another, and like the foolish Arcadians, exposed to the pray of whosoever would assaile them, yet could we not reforme this mischeife, they haveing Pattents granted from the Court in England to plant wheresoever they pleased contrarie to all order, discipline, and Example: but how well we beganne to build (though impossible to continue) on this prescribed foundation I conjecture is not unknowne unto you; Neither could the Trecherie of the Indians (although foreknowne) have beene but in part prevented: who like violent lightening are gone as soone as perceived. Yet are we taxed with indiscretion and Cowardize for drawing these miserable people into these miserable complaining places of securitie; Who had neither victuall nor ammunition (nor could we help them with either) nor of strength to defend themselves: so that of necessitie they must have perished either by the Enimye, or famyne. But men that are ambitious to be counted wise will rather Justifie than acknowledge a fault in their Errors and impute the fault to the execution, when it is indeed in the project not in the execution. We held not ourselves secure said an ignoble Noble man unless we had 1000 Souldiers to guard us; what a strict affinity is there between the divell and a lyer! for my owne part I received not a man into my Plantation although at one time I was so weake that I could not arme 5 able men: and for the Governour, the Councellors themselves were constrained to watch nightlie by turnes until the Countrye allowed him a guard of 30 men. Sir Edwin writes that strucke with a Panicke feare we proposed a Removeall of the Collonie to the Easterne shore. Indeed I writt home of such a proposition and named the Proposer with his Arguments which were hotlie maintained by others, (and no question but that place had beene better, at the first, to have seated on, in regard of...",

But I pray God their Contemplations doe not so outweigh our experience that all in the end Come to nothing: who think every thing done as soon as Conceived (how unfeasable soever) and so heighten their proceedings that it is Impossible for our Actions to goe along with their reports whereby we must of necessity suffer in our reputations. We are much upbraided with Sr Thomas Dale: yet (not to detract from the dead) what did he? or what is extant of his Endeavours? or what Could not we doe if we (as hee) had 300 men at our owne disposure, both fed and appareled out of England? whereas we have not one except we hire them with our private purses. They have taken them Injuriouslie from their Masters. The Tenants they sent on that absurd Condition of halves are neither able to sustaine themselves nor discharge their moyetie, and are so dejected with their Scarce provisions, and finding nothing to answeare their expectation, that most give themselves over, and die of Melancholye, the rest running so farre in debt as keepes them still behind hand, and many (not seldome) losing their Crops whilst they hunt for their Bellyes: Nor are their Commanders much better, who having little performed of what was promised, their means not worth the Collecting, cont their minds to other Imployments. And now least we should growe too rich they have sent over (without any advice from us) a Captaine of a shipp, with extreme charges to the Countrye, to build a fort in the Sea (it might have suited a Castle in the aire) on a shoal of oyster shells every tide overflowne, and at lowe water with every wind washt over by the surges; where when you have pearced the upper Crust, there is for many speares lengths no bottome to be found. The Captaine dyed, to save his Credit, soon after. And I feare that their too much vaine glorie and presumption at home, together with our sins have drawne these afflictions upon us; the massacre being seconded with penal sickness, insomuch as we have lost I believe few lesse than 500, and not many of the rest that have not knockt at the doores of death. yet with our small and weake forces we have Chased the Indians from their aboads, burnt their houses, taken their Corne and slayne not a few.",
