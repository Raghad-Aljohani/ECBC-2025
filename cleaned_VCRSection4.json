But the Earl of Southampton said they were gonne quite from the buissines they had in hand and asked Mr. Wrote why he refused to be tryed by this Court who aunsweared, he had iust cause to decline the testimonies of such as were partiall but desired he might haue liberty to take a full information from those that were then present the Court consistinge of Threescore persons: and complained of the longe intermission of the Company as if they had bin put off to his preiudice.

Wherevpon Sr Iohn Brooke acknowledged the trueth of what the Lord Cauendish had deliuered and for that reason the Court was put of: But Mr Wrote said he offered not any Submission, but desired peace vpon certaine free conditions vizt, That his suspension from the Counsell should be revoaked, that he should be restored to my Lord of Southamptons fauor and that nothing should be entred in the Court to his disparagement: Wherevnto Sr John Brooke replied that he did not well remember what was then in perticular spoken for he did not thinke he should be called to an Account for it, but said his principall end and ayme in this was to haue made a peace if it had bin possible. Mr Brooke said that somethinge of necessity must be donn for the honor of this Court wch had bin much scandalized by Mr Wrote as for Mr Wrots appeale to a Quarter Court he said, it was rather an Appeale from the Quarter Court by Spinninge out the time: And whereas Mr Wrote moued for liberty to appointe some to take depositions of Wittnesses on his behalfe he held his motion to be verie inconvenient and vnfit, for neither could any but the Deputy and Secretary take the depositions, and beside such manner of proceeding would cause a number of great inconveniences that would neuer haue an end, and wished Mr Wrote to be better aduised in his speeches, and not seeke thereby to abuse mens iudgements for whereas he said the proceeding of the Parliament vpon an offender was no president for an Inferior Court, he said, the greater Court is, the better president; and that an affront euen to the Court of Pipowder is lyable to censure and punishment, and therefore much more to so Honorable a Court as this was.

Mr Deputy said he was no Accuser of Mr Wrote as was well known, for the true recording of the Court it was the duty of his place and protesting that he did not know of any thing set downe amiss nor willingly omitted any thing to Mr Wrote's prejudice, and besought the Earl of Southampton that the Court might be examined by parte. Mr Herbert said that it was to be considered whether they will by Witnesses or by the whole Court then present examine whether the said Courts be truly or falsely set downe which he conceived was most fitly to be done by those that were then present. Mr Lawrence Hide said that the Custome of the Court is the lawe of the Court and finde Mr Wrote hath erred exceedingly against it, and cannot excuse him of folly that he moves from flying from the Court, and therefore admonished him to confesse his error and if he refuse, he fears he hath some worse ends in this course he holds. The Earl of Southampton after many digressions made by Mr Wrote recalled him to the present business of the Court in question demanding of him what exceptions he could take against it, Mr Wrote replied he excepted in every particular matter in that Court that concerned him. At length for rectifying the Court and for making this a leading President, it was proposed whether the Company Court would admit of any examination of Witnesses upon oath and such other courses as Mr Wrote desired for Trial of this business or no, or whether they would try it by the testimony of them that were present which being",

The Earl of Southampton also desired so many of the said Court as were nowe present would take notice of the meetinge on ffriday in case the Officer should not warne them all, in respect the Secretary had not taken the names of all that were present at that Court.

But the Ea: of Southampton said that this was not the buissines they had nowe in hand nor pertinent therevnto, but should be taken into consideration in due time and place and therefore required Mr Deputy to declare in ble breife the matters that Mr Wrote did so much inveigh against at the last Court: Wherevpon Mr Deputy said that Mr Wrote did then insist vpon these three points vizt.\n\n1.

Wherevpon Mr Brooke the Lawyer said that in all Courts of iustice it was a thinge certaine that if a man speake to the disgrace of the Judge or his iudgement [or the Court] he was subiect to fine and comittment at the pleasure of the Judge, and so in priuate Corporations where any shall speake to the disgrace of the person of the Gouernor or Acte of the Court or gouerment thereof, he conceaued the like censure and punishment might passe vpon him.

Mr Deputy beinge againe much pressed by the Lords to deliuer clearely and fully what Mr Wrote had spoken in open Court as being bound so to doe by the duety of his place (especially when he was therevnto required by the Counsell) said that he well remembred that Mr Wrote said then the buissines was not carried fairely and did also well remem- ber that himselfe did saye the buissines was not surreptitiously car- ried, but whither Mr Wrote said the buissines [It] was surreptitiously carried or no, he remembred not, but he conceaued he spake not onely of the proceeding of the Comittee but generally of the whole buissines.

Mr. Wrote replied that he said the Quarter Court had no power by the lawes of the Companie to deriue that authority they did to an inferiour Court except in cases, either of inevitable necessity or evident vtility but in this case there was no such thinge to enforce the same: Wherevnto Sr. Edwin Sandys made Answeare that by his owne words it was apparant he questioned the power of the Quarter Court and therefore his speach concerned the maine body of the Contract, but he said he would nowe goe vpon his owne graunt and that forsomuch as the maine bodie of the Contract was so solemly ratified in a Quarter Court and that there fell out some smale difference between the Lord Treasuror and the Companie which could not be at that time accorded without further conference, there was herevpon an inevitable necessity of transmittinge the authority of the said Quarter Court vnto another Court to ioyne with the said Sufier Tlande Companie in their ||Quarter|| Court to debate further of the said differences, and to ioyne in a finall conclusion of the said Bargaine and other things thereto incident.

But touchinge Mr. Wrots carriage of himselfe in this buissines he said he had obserued two mayne materiall exceptions which in his opinion were iustly to be taken against him, first for that he inveighed against that which beinge ordered by the Quarter Court could not be reformed for the present, Secondly in that he sought to mainetaine his opinion by misallega\u00e9ons aswell of the lawes of the Realme, as also of the lawes of this Companie by the one dishartninge and deterringe of the Companie from proceedinge in the Contract as it was nowe concluded and ordered, by the other insinuatinge into the minde of his Hearers a conceit of ill carriage by the Counsell and Comittees contrary to the established lawes and orders of the Companie. Touchinge the lawes of the Realme he said that Mr. Wrote then deliuered that by drawinge the generall body of the Companie into bearinge a part of this Contract and by giuinge the Seale for the pformance thereof they engaged the priuate estate of euery pticuler Member to be aunswearable to the Kinge what dammage soeuer should befall in which Allega\u00e9on as he clearely failed in his indgement in pointe of lawe so he vsed this ill meanes to a worse end, and conclusion namly the disturbance of the Contract so solemnly concluded with the Kinge and nowe not to be revoaked.

In reply hereunto Mr. Wrote bid Sir Edwin Sandys put his speech into a Syllogisme, and then he would answer it for it was Argumentum a Desperatis. [130] Touching the matter of the lawe of the Realme Mr. Herbert being now present was desired to deliver his opinion who said that without all question the private estate of men could not by lawe be made lyable to pay that for which the whole Companie stood engaged, unless there did appear a practice in some of the Companie to decline the debt by indirect means of which opinion Mr. Brooke was also and cited a case long since tried in Westminster Hall upon occasion of one that being a member of the Corporation of Norwich that stood engaged at that time for debt was arrested in Westminster Hall for the Debt of the said Corporation, which matter being forthwith brought to trial he was acquitted by the judgment of the Court for that the lawe in that case looked not upon any particular man's person or estate but the whole body of the Corporation as it is united and not in the lawe which Mr. Wrote had cited with a kind of scorn and contempt by terming it to be one of Sir Edwin Sandys' lawes which saith if any particular man proposed any matter of charge unto the Companie and could not find means to defray the charge and uphold the Project, he was to be excluded from coming to Court: It plainly appeared by the word of the Lawe itself to have been both misalleged and misapplied. My Lord of Southampton demanded of Mr. Wrote, why he did raise and maintain so strangely that dangerous Proposition of the Seale, it being a point of lawe and he no lawyer. 16456\u2014vol 2\u201406\u2014\u201413",

Hereupon the Earl of Southampton told him that he now saw his indiscretion to be as great as he took it to be, that being of the Counsell he would not impart his mind concerning that point first unto them, but rather divulge his opinion in open Court to the prejudice of so main a business as the Contract was and that before he was sufficiently grounded in that which he spake as appeared by his own report in asking Counsel after he had so confidently published his opinion. With this Mr. Wrote departed saying that he came not thither to hear ill words.

Mr. Deputy answered he knew nothing of that Mr. Wrote spake but he was credibly informed that divers strangers not free of the Company were there in favor of Mr. Wrote and in particular two Tobacconists whose greatest desire is to overthrow the bargain, one of them he knew being his next neighbor who did most violently urge, that Mr. Wrote might have a Coppie. To this Mr. Wrote replied that divers lackies and Servingmen at the Lower end of the Hall held up their hands against him and complained of Mr. Carter for it. But Mr. Deputy answered that the matter of Coppie was carried by a very great deal of Odds in the number of hands and that of those that sat in the body of the Hall.

Whereupon his Lordship put his former Proposition to the question, viz. that the Court should be wholly read over and afterward examined by part, and so the Court was entirely read over which being done it was the second time begun to be read and Mr. Wrote willed to make his exceptions. Whereupon Mr. Wrote said that there was an omission in the very front viz. that Mr. Deputy presently after the setting down of the Court excused himself that the Court kept on the Sufier Island Quarter Court day could not be then read because it was not drawn up for want of time, and therefore desired that the reading of the Court might be put off till the next Court following it, and this exception he said was very considerable for if the Court had been read wherein was declared how the business of Salaries passed, it would perhaps have so well informed him, that he should not have spoken so much as he did. This Omission Mr. Deputy confessed to be true but protested it was not out of willingness but of forgetfulness, and so did the Secretary whereupon it was ordered to be inserted as appeareth in the said Court.",

Mr. Kightly taking notice of the great losse the Adventurers were like to sustain of their principall money after so long forbearance said that he had heard it credibly reported, that their Capemarchant was at first a very poore man, but through his employment in the said Magazine, was become exceedingly rich, whereas his bargaine was that he should be recompensed out of the gaines of their Stocke: he therefore wished that the business might be strictly looked into.

The first Steppe was that worthie men would please freely to continue their paines and bestowe their laboures in this buissines as others had donn for many yeares together. That if Salaries be graunted they might be by the waye of honorarie or gratuities in reward of service donne. And if by a Stipendcy then not to propose so great a Some as 2500li wch is 3li per upon 200000 waight for this he said would deterr the Importation of Tobacco and if that faile the Companie will smart for it.

Mr Wilmer said he was verie much discouraged and so were others whereof he would nowe shewe the cause. The first cause was about the importation of the Spanish Tobacco. The second touchinge the Salaries. First he said in the Preamble to the Roll he had observed that the Companie are to beare a 10th part in the joint Stocke for bringinge home of Spanish Tobacco and gave their Seale for the Security. Whereby he conceived that if the joint Stocke faile private mens estate both here and in Virginia are lyable to make good the Companies",

[153] Furthermore in the Preamble there is no caution or dispensation mentioned, in case the Kinge of Spaine shall raise the price of Tobacco which he hath alreadie donn as he is credibly informed. Also he observeth that the Undertakers have but one yeare graunted them, for the bringing in of the Spanish Tobacco, which by reason so great quantity thereof is here already in this Kingdome cannot be brought in but with much losse or verie smale gaine if the price thereof be enhanced in Spayne. It beinge almost 6, of the Clocke it was upon motion generally agreed by erection of hands that the Court should be continued duringe pleasure. This donne Mr. Wilmer was desired to proceed. Whereupon he said he had observed also in the Roll that the Importation of Spanish Tobacco is to be consigned to the Comittee by whom that business is to be managed to the benefit of the Undertakers who are to have no votes in the carriage of that business but must be wholly left to the care of the Director and Comittees. His second cause of discouragement he said was the matter of Salaries but spake not of it to any but the Comittees. His first reason for that the matter of Salaries as he hath heard here in Court was sodainely and unduely carried, that the Comittee treated superficially thereof by the fireside that the Deputy was called awaye and thereupon that Comittee brake up and did nothinge: At the next meetinge it was sodainely concluded upon and so brought to the Quarter Court where he observed a great deale of silence and many hands held up against it. 2 Reason that the Salaries were unseasonably given because no service was performed nor was it known howe well they would be deserved as also in respect there is no money in Cash, but the Companie verie much in debt.",

And it is not to be doubted but that there will be found so many worthie members of both Companies as will upon these Termes for one yeare and more rather than the buissines shall fall to the ground to begin this Hillary Terme to undertake this buissines, for considering that many divers for divers yeares past even for conscience sake have with great alacrity given their assiduous attendance for the Dispatch of the most waightie buissines of the Plantations, when it was only the worke of Societies now that thereunto there is adjoined the service of his most Excellent Ma\u1d57\u1d57 who never leaves unrewarded those that labor for him, there will be I dare affirme a vertuous strife and emulation amongst us who shall be honoured with this imployment: These Officers should meet two Dayes in the weeke at least and oftner if neede be.

And in case that part of the Contract be punctually observed that all the Tobacco to be sold in bancke it will be necessary to draw a preamble to a second roll whereby the Brothers of the Companies may be admitted to subscribe what Somes they shall thereby be limited for the buying of the Tobacco which poor Planters shall bring into this Kingdom that they may not suffer by expecting the sale of their goods and attendance for money. In this proposition of a certain Salary I rather give way to other men's opinions than follow mine own judgment for I determine not that this is the best course but propose it as a better than that which is already established for if it be possible to manage the buissines so, I could wish these pensions were changed into gratuities according to the merit of every man's endeavor at the end of the year when the buissines is done, and it plainly appears that the project answers expectation in point of profit: These two courses thus offered to the judgment of the Court I humbly submit to the censure of this Honorable Companie and if they be pleased to embrace either of them my desire is they will commend that course they best like to the Virginia Companie to be also approved by them.",

Touchinge which it was first thought fitt to consider whither this newe waye were a good waye or noe and whither it be better then the other waye. Sr. Robert Killigrewe demaunded first, howe it was in other Companies it was generally acknowledged that all Iointe Stocke whatsoeuer are managed by one cheife man and next vnder him some other in the nature of a Deputy as the Companie had already ordered and that the course propounded in the Article read was without all President: And it was declared howe that the Companie ioyninge in a Magazine together, which did not exceed 7000\u00a3 in the vnderwritinge it was yet thought necessarie to choose a Director for the managinge of it, and the like course was held in all manner of Iointe Stocke whither for trade or Plantation beinge all committed to some one man as Director or Gouernor, and therefore it was dangerous to followe a newe waye neuer before trodden. Secondly it was obiected that the two Companies haue more buissines already then they can well pforme and therefore they would neuer be drawne together vpon such occasions so frequently as were necessarie.

First it was obiected that the Salary of 100 li was so smale as there might almost be as much lost in tellinge of so much money wch in receauinge and payinge could not be lesse then 100000 li and that to giue a 100 li to a man of such sufficiency as that place required and that must vndergoe so great a charge as that was, and that must giue continuall attendance thereon, was an vnreasonable thinge nor would any man vndertake it except some that ment by the imployinge of the money or otherwise to make some extraordinary benifitt. It was also alledged that the East India Companie when their Stocke was but 100000 li p Anim had giuen 300 li and sometimes 4 or 500 li to their Treasuror. It was also declared that of necessity the Treasuror must engage himselfe for takinge vp of moneyes for the buissines especially for the payment of custome. In the end after much debate and dispute of the matter, the Court generally agreed, that the reward of 100 li was nothinge proportionable and seemed so sensible of the smalenes of the Salary and the greatnes of the charge and paines, as they generally declared themselues vnwillinge to accept of the seruice of any such as would for such a matter, vndertake it: wherevpon his lp: vpon that Proposition made these two questions (vizt)",

[161]\n\nMy Lord of Southampton willed Mr. Deputy to declare what the Company had concluded in this point, who answered that they had thought fit there should be two Cashiers one continually to remain in the Treasury for receipt and payment of moneys, and other continually to go about to call and receive such moneys as daily grow due.\n\nSir Edwin Sandys said he considered in this business a twofold Action the one of receiving the other of paying and was of opinion that",

Mr. Wither said that he was of opinion that there must be added a Third Cashier in regard that there would be an infinity of Bills and specialities, receipts and acquittances to be made which would almost take up one man's whole time. And whereas it was alleged that the Treasurer might employ his own Servant that was not adjudged reasonable to require it: And whereas it was said that this matter and other Offices would be performed in great part for love, and for the part publique benefit, Sr. Edwa: Sackvill said [replyed] that he had heard great and worthie Merchants ingenuously protest that their end was their own private profit and not the publique good which did belong to publique persons and not to private men. Mr. Io: Smith said that havinge spent upon Virginia a verie great matter, he did by God's blessing hope to receive this yeare, a good quantity of Tobacco which he would not willingly have come under the hande of them that would performe the business for love and not upon a good and competent Salary, and his opinion was, that the employment of these Salaried Cashiers would be so great as they should be enforced to keep Servants under them, for from them must come the Instructions to sue out Processe, Bills, Informations, Declarations. &c. Whereupon it beinge put to the question whether they thought it possible that one Cashier can performe the business of this charge, It was passed by a general erection of hande (save only one) that it was not possible: And beinge put to the question whether they held it necessarie to have two Cashiers it was generally agreed unto. [162] After this was read the 4 Proposition which was as followeth (vizt) There may be ten Committees, whereof fower to be chosen by the Sumer Hands Companie of the number of their Assistants and six by the Virginia Companie to each Committee 20\" Salary may be allotted.",
    "881": "234 | RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nThe Addition to the number of the Committees was not disliked but for the Salary of 20 li to each it was adjudged much too little: For whereas by the Project they were to meet at least two days in the week, Sr Edward Sackvill said that that was but 11 groats a day, but he was of opinion that they should be enforced to meet so often as perhaps it would not come to 12 d a day. It was also said that men being in Trade whether Merchants or Shopkeepers could not spend so much time for so little but very much to the prejudice and neglect of their estates; which when they should perceive although they might perhaps at first begin out of the abundance of conscience yet that would quickly fail and thinking themselves bound by a great bond of conscience to provide for their own charge will either negligently follow the business or else perhaps seek some indirect courses to satisfy themselves to the full of their pains and labor, which reasons and divers others being well considered of his lp: at length put it to the question whether the Company did think Ten Committees so salariated as in the Article is set down, would suffice to do the business to the content of the Company, it was by a general erection of hands (only two dissenting) denied and disliked. It was also put to the question whether they had rather have 8 Committees with 50 li a piece as was formerly ordered it was generally agreed. After this was read the fifth Article which is as followeth (vizt:) There may six gentlemen be chosen indifferently out of both Companies which may be in quality of Assistants to the Treasurer to whom no Salary shall be allotted, but in case the business proves by their industry and good carriage profitable the Company may with some small gratuity testify their good acceptance of their endeavors and also commend them further to the Lord Treasurer of whom it may be hoped that he will be pleased to consent to give such a moderate gift.

The abatement of allowance for the Bookeeper and Beadle were disliked, And for the matter of the Husband who must be a man of creditt and worth beinge to haue vnder his hand the whole Stocke and bound to giue continuall attendance, the allowance of 15 li was adiudged that he must give a Servant vnder him more Wherefore the Article beinge put to the question it was by a generall erection of hands disliked, and on the contrary the Salaries proportioned by the Companies well liked and approued. After this was read the 7 Article vizt To a Clarke for to waite wholly vpon that buissines 30 li.

And further that the bringing in of the 40000 w\u1d57 was strictly tied to one yeares Terme and so the Adventurers had not the same liberty as was by the Contract graunted to the Companie. Thirdly he desired that if the Companie would beare a part, they would give better security then their Seale. M\u1d63 Mole also said that he conceived that the matter of fower Shares and the lendinge of the Companie a Tenth part hindred many Adventurers: Hereupon the Roll was read and for m\u1d63 Wilmotts doubts it appeared plainely, that the Undertakers of the first 40000 weight, if they would they might bringe in the rest excludinge all others and if not they might leave it w\u1d57 was conceived a verie advantageable pointe vnto them. For the second it was declared that the Companies intent was to graunt these undertakers as much liberty as themselues had and so it was in the beginninge plainely expressed where it is said that they",

For Mr. Moles Objections it was aunsweared that if he could certainely saye that any considerable Some would be brought in, if that clause of buyinge fower Shares were remitted the Companie would consider of it, but otherwise without aduantage to alter it were but to shewe vnconstancy, and as for lendinge the Companies a Tenth part of the Stocke brought in since by other meanes, the Companie could not beare a part, the Aduenturers that had already vnderwritten had desired that clause, and without the Companies beare a part with them they would withdrawe the Somes they had vnderwritten, which diuers of them beinge present confirmed. After this the Article of the Roll was put to the question, that excepted that was before, It was by erection of hands generally disliked.

After this was read the last part of Mr. Wrotes Proiect wch followeth, I could wish these pentions were changed into gratuities accordinge to the merrit of every mans endeauour at the end of the yeare when the buissines is donn, and it plainely appeares that the Proiect aunsweares expectation in pointe of proffitt: The course therein propounded for gratuities was vtterly disliked it beinge contrary to the Contract with his Ma[jes]tie wherein it was agreed that the Officers should be rewarded by Salaries.\n\nAnd herevpon Sr. Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to acquainte the Court howe by the Contract his Ma[jes]tie is to receaue his part at our lady day and Michalmas accordinge to the proporcions that shalbe then receaued.

My Lo: of Southton put it to the question whither they did concurre with Mr. Wrotes wish in this last part of his Proiect, the affirmatiue had no hands, the Negatiue had all. Mr. Rider moued that some speedie order might be taken for ready Sale of the poore Planters Tobacco: But he was aunsweared that no certaine order could as yet be made therein, but the Counsell and Committees would take it into their care and himselfe and all others were desired to consider what course they could finde. The Ea: of Southampton said that whereas Mr. Wrote brought a Proiect vnto the Court with an opinion of proposinge a better and thriftier waye for managinge the Tobacco: The Companie hauinge this day exactly examined by parts in euery perticuler haue with a generall consent dissallowed of them, saue onely in that clause that agrees with the former order.

And Sir Samuell Sandys said that a little before as he was coming to the Court he met Mr. Wrott coming from the Court, and asking him whither he went Mr. Wrote said he was verie ill at ease and could not staye. [174] The Lo Cauendish said that he remembered that Mr. Wrote had on the Monday appealed unto the Kinge and to such Delegates as his Ma\u201c should appoint, and supposed that he did persist in that resolution and therefore seemed to require the judgement of those learned gentlemen that professed the studie of the lawe what in this case was to be done. Whereunto Mr. Brooke made answer, that Mr. Wrote having appealed, if either by sufficient testimony of any present, or by other good evidence it could be made appear unto the Court, that his Ma\u201c hath accepted of that appeal, then the Court was bound without any farther meddling in the business to reserve the matter entire to his Ma\u201c pleasure from whom they derived all the power and authority they have, But seeing neither Mr. Wrote himself appeared nor any other signified any such thing, he did not conceive that the Company was any way debarred by his pretended appeal (which being",

Hee further said that of all his calumnies and Accusations there was none more vniust, nor more apparantly vntrue then that wherewith he had charged (though not by name yet by necessarie inference) my Lord of Southampton himselfe, namely that the Companie were so ouerawed that their liberty of speaking was taken away from them, now what mischief haue ensued herevpon euery man might apprehend, for it appeared by Sir Henry Mildmayes speach, that his Maiesties eares haue bin possessed therewith, euen as Mr. Wrote with his friend and familiar hath filled all parts of the Citty and Country with like causeles clamors and brought great scandall vpon the Companie, which wronge so great, so vniust and so pernicious, if they should be suffred to continue and proceed without repressing them, he saw not but the whole gouernment of the Companie must withall dissolue and fall into extreame scorne, contempt, and confusion.

Sr. Iohn Dauers said that hauing seen Mr. Wrote present himselfe since the sittinge of the Court, and afterwardes findinge that he had withdrawne himselfe, it seemed plaine to him, that he had deserted his cause wch he sawe he could not mainetaine, and therefore he did not thinke it fitt to loose any longer time in expectinge him but to proceed to the sentencinge of him, but yet before that was donn he thought it fitt that those imputations, charges, and accusations wch Mr. Wrote had laid vpon the proceedings of the Counsell and Companies in the buissines of the Contract, and perticulerly of the Salaries, should be propounded to the iudgement of the Court; (vizt) whither they did approve all or any of them to be true wch course was well liked: Wherevpon his Lp: put it to the question whither they did not thinke that those exceptions, charges, imputations, and Accusations laid by Mr. Wrote were not false and slaunderous, It was by a generall erection of hands adiudged that they were false and slaunderous noe one dissentinge.

The third offence which Mr. Wrote committed in that Court was under a pious pretence of the poor Planters good, to lay a foundation and groundwork to nourish a discontent and dislike in the Planters minds concerning the Contract and the Companies, and to set himself up for a Champion and Patron of them, as though the Companie",

    "922": "FEBRUARY 19, 1683\n\nMr Caswell said the mentioning of passing certaine shares in the end of the Court nowe read did bring to his remembrance a thing which diuers good members of the Companie had with much solicitousnes & care and oftentimes thought and treated of, that is concerning the manner of admitting men to the freedome of this Companie which seemed to them to be done with more speed and lesse care and consideration then were requisite in a busines of so high importance as the Plantations are which as it is well knowne haue many and sore enimies diuers of which (perhaps to the intent they may do the more harme) seeke to obtaine the freedome of the Companie; and that as admissions nowe passe (vizt) vpon the first proposing could not be avoyded nor hindred. Wherefore for the preventing of so great inconveniences as the coming in of such persons would breed to the Companie, his motion was that it should be ordered and made a lawe that no enimy or open hinderer of the Plantations or vnworthie should be admitted into this Society, and for the better keeping of them out he propounded that it might be ordered that if exceptions should be taken against any person that should be propounded, either as an enimy or euill willer to the Plantations or otherwise not worthie of this Society that the admission of such persons should not be imediately graunted at the same Court but respited to the pleasure of the Quarter Court next followinge. [196] The Ea: of Southampton said he had not heretofore heard of the Proposition of Mr Caswell but vpon the first view it seemed to him verie good and reasonable that there should be good care and order held in the admission of men to the Company of Virginia and the Sumer Ilands, diuers others likewise of the Companie commended Mr Caswell's motion, and that the rather because that whereas in all other Companies men take an oath to be true and faithfull to the Companie in these Companies there is no such thing: Wherefore it were fitt that since that time tie and obligation is here wantinge, that there should be so much the more care and consideration had in admitting of men.",
    "923": "276 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nBut against this it was obiected that it was contrarie to the lawes of the Companie, wch said that admission shall not be denied where it is due: And it was further alledged that the Land in Virginia beinge held in free Soccage it could not by the lawes of the Realme be forbidden, but a man might sell and put ouer his land to whome he pleased, and therefore the Companie could not deny to admitt any man.\n\nTo the first it was answeared that the lawes of the Virginia Companie, did not speake one waye or other concerninge that matter, but that that clause was in the Sumer Ilandes Lawes wch yet could not be so farr strained as that therefore any enimy or vnworthie pson should be admitted. For the wordes are ||where it is|| apparantly due But certainely it is iustly questionable whither an enimy or vnworthie person should be admitted But for the second obiection the Ea: of Southampton said that he did not vnderstand ||the Proposition|| to be ment concerninge the passinge of Right and possession of landes but onely concerninge the giuinge of vote and settinge in Courtes wch a man might be debarred of, although he had not onely right but possession of landes in either of the Companies as was euident by the example of Mr. Wrote who although he was vtterly disabled from cominge to the Courtes yet his landes and ffreeholdes in both the Plantations were not taken from him: Wherefore although the Companie might not deny or debarr any man from sellinge his land to whome he pleased, yet they might refuse to accept of an vnworthie pson as to haue voice amongst them: And this Mr. Christofer Brooke said was ||not|| onely ||not|| contrary but agreeable to the Lawes, for in diuers cases of right there was sued out notwithstandinge a writt of Ad quod Damnum before the thinge desired could be effected, And this respite of Admittance desired, was in effect no other then as a writt Ad quod Damnum wch beinge returned and cleared the Admittance would of it selfe ensue.

    "924": "FEBRUARY 19, 1628\n\nto the Companie wch is to be vnderstood from hauinge voice in Courte onely for it is not questionable, but that though a man be indebted to the Companie, he may passe his lands to any other, and that he that shall buy it shall haue as good right and title as the first had, but yet by the lawes of the Companie he cannot haue voice in the Courte vntill the debt be satisfied to the Companie, wherefore if in this case the Companie deny admission much more may they do it vpon such other waightie exceptions as were propounded. But it was further obiected that if vpon exception taken against a person propounded the Admission should be delayed and the matter referred to the Quarter Court, it would be in the power of any malicious man to affront and disgrace whome he pleased, and either he must sett downe with the repulse or else put himselfe vpon a Tryall and censure of a multitude, whereby although he should in the end be iustified, yet he might incurr much disreputation and in the meane while haue his good name tossed vp and downe in mens mouthes: Wherefore they were of opinion that that course would be full of Scandall: as for clearinge the Companie of vnworthie Members; it was in the Companies power vpon iust reasons to expell them and cast them out. But the Ea: of Southampton aunsweared that it was both easier and safer to prevent the admittinge them, then beinge admitted to cast them out, and for the former part of the exception that they should gaine much more credditt by beinge so hono\u1d58\u02b3 cleared then they could suffer disreputation by beinge maliciously excepted against, and that consideringe the great shame and infamy that he that should maliciously call anothers worke in question should vndergoe men would be wary howe they hazarded their owne fame and good reputation in callinge others in question, wherefore this danger would hardly light vpon any that deserued it not.

    "928": "FEBRUARY 19, 1682/3\n\nWhereupon Mr Deputy desired of both the Companies diligent and careful attention because the points were weighty and full of difficulties and further besought them freely to make what Objections they could in every particular for so either they should be satisfied or the thing amended. First therefore he said, that the Committees consideration did begin at those particulars, where the Contract ended, which how far it went the 6th Article expressed viz. That not only the sole Importation but the sole sale was to be managed by the Companies that is (as there is explained) by such Officers as the Companies should choose and depute: This he said he did think necessary to promise for the answering of those doubts and exceptions which he had heard by many both publicly and privately made (viz.) that they should be debarred of the possessions of their own goods, that they must trust the sale of them to others. For this condition did arise immediately and was inherent in the very Contract itself, so that whosoever would enjoy the liberty or benefit of bringing in Tobacco hither must without dispute resolve to submit himself thereunto, and therefore he desired that no man would call those things in question but for the safe and secure custody both of the goods themselves and also of the money after they should come into the Officers hands and for the fair just and equal ordering and disposing and selling of the Commodity and that to the best profit and advantage both of the Companies and his Majesty the Director and Committees had propounded these courses following to be held, which he would in the selfsame order relate as they were by them considered of. First therefore to begin with the arrival of the goods here they conceived fit that some Officers men of trust and that should take an oath should immediately be sent aboard the Ships to take care that no Tobacco should be stolen out of the Ships but all might be duly brought into the Companies hands. Secondly that the Masters of Ships and such others as should be thought requisite should upon their oaths be examined and charged to deliver a true and faithful Invoice of all the Tobacco brought home in their Ships.

But this course as it would take away all meanes of doeinge wronge, so it would take away all scruples and feares out of mens minds. This pointe being related thus by Mr Deputy diuers of the Companie spake in approbation of the course prescribed, but no man makinge any obiection against it, onely diuers required that if it were possible the Warehowses and Storehowses might be all in the Companies howse or at least as neare as possible could be, and Mr Roberts desired that the Virginia and Sumer Ilands Tobacco should be kept in seuerall roomes; To wch Answeare was made, it was so vnderstood because there were seuerall Accounts to be kept of them. And that not onely the Tobaccoes of the two Plantations were to be kept assunder but the seuerall sorts of either Plantation were likewise to be kept in seuerall Roomes: It was also demanded by some howe the Husband should doe when occasion should require that the Tobacco should be shewed in seuerall warehowses, to wch it was aunsweared that he should haue vnder him an inferiour Warehowse Keeper, and if there were occasion to be in many Warehowses at once he might depute others in his place who should be paide for their paines, but without two Committees no man should medle any goode.",
    "931": "284 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nIn the end the Court desired his Lp: put it to the question whither this course propounded by the Committees did satisfie the Companie in the point of safe keepinge their goods, and whither they would rest satisfied with this Security and so order, that this Course propounded should be held.

Wherefore they thought it better both for the present and for hereafter to turn their thoughts to the settling of such a course and form as might prevent that no damage could happen, rather than how it should be repaired after the loss came, which the way of Bonds and Suretyships only implied, and did not always prove so effectual as it seemed to carry show, by reason that many casualties might happen and many courses might be taken whereby the Security would be frustrated: Wherefore after mature deliberation they fell upon this course following. First that there should be a safe and strong room chosen in the Companies house for the Keeping of the moneys that shall be received and strong Iron Chests provided to put the money in: and that both the Chests and room should be under three locks and keys, whereof one should be in the Keeping of the Treasurer of the Virginia Company, one other in the keeping of the Governor of the Summer Islands Company and the Third the Treasurer for this Contract should have, So that the Treasurer should not go into the Treasury without the knowledge and consent of the two aforesaid Governors nor otherwise than with them or at least some persons of worth and sufficiency deputed by them: For in regard that it cannot be that such noble personages should have leisure so often as need might require to be personally present, it was therefore thought fit that the Treasurer of Virginia might leave his key with some one of the Counsel and the Governor of the Summer Islands with some of the Assistants, [204] So that by this means it was conceived that the money after it was brought into the Treasury would be safer and better secured than by any Bond or Suretyships whatsoever. As for the bringing of money in and that the Treasurer should not be at any one time possessed of any great Sum, it was thought fit that once every week the Director or Committees or some of them together with the aforesaid Governors or their Substitute should take",

And in case the payments should come in, in great abundance; the same course might be held twice or oftner in the same weeke. So that by this meanes the Treasurer should neuer be possessed at any one time of any greater Some then himselfe should be adiudged sufficient wittnesse Security for. And further to the intent that the Treasurer should not be able by any art or cunninge to detayne to his owne priuate vse any moneyes that he should receaue, it was thought fitt that beside his Cash booke (w\u1d57\u02b0 vpon demaund he should alwayes bringe out to the aforesaid Officers) there should be kept a booke in a plaine and orderly manner, expressinge what goods are sold for ready money and what vpon time to whome and when it falls out due; Which booke shall lye open to the veiwe and pervsall not onely of the Officers, but of any Brother of the Companie, by which meanes it is conceaued that not onely all fraude in the Treasurer wilbe prevented; But also many other good effects will followe for thereby the Comittees (to whome the sale of the goods is referred) shalbe sure to haue good information by the recourse of them that wilbe desirous to see this booke of the habilities and sufficiencie of those with whome they deale. This pointe beinge thus reported by Mr. Deputy there was a generall approbation of the course many commendinge it but not any one objectinge against it: Wherevpon his lp: was desired to put it to the question which his lp: did in this manner. Whither they did iudge their weyes moneyes would be sufficiently secured by this course without further security of Bond or Suertiship from the Treasurer, and whither they would agree and order that this course should be held in this point it was by a generall erection of hands (not one dissentinge) iudged that by this meanes the moneyes would be sufficiently secured, and it was ordered that this course should be held concerninge the Treasury. [205]",
    "934": "FEBRUARY 19, 1628\n\nThese things thus established concerning the safe custody of goods and money Mr. Deputy said thus, the next consideration of the Directors and Committees was concerning the disposing and selling of the goods with that it might be done in a just and equall manner both for the King and the Owners, since not only the Tobacco of severall men would be of different goodnes and worth, even the selfe same parcell would perhaps containe Tobacco of two or three very different sorts for price and worth it was therefore before all other things absolutely necessarie to have every mans parcell viewed and judged of what condition and goodnes it were and if it were not all alike that the different sorts should be distinguished and severed and this difference they conceived might be reduced to three kinds best, middle, and worst by which course every man should have the true proceed of his owne goods, and the full and just price according to the condition and worth of his Tobacco without either receiving or doing wrong by having his Tobacco mingled with others being of the same goodnes and worth as his is. As for the true and faithfull distinguishing of these severall sorts, it was conceived it should be done by men skillfull in the nature of Tobacco who should be chosen by the Companie in their Court and have an oath administred unto them to do it without any manner of partiality either of favor or hatred, and that they should thus sort the Tobacco in the presence of the Husband and at least two of the Committees who should keep an exact Account how every mans parcell is by these Sorters judged and esteemed, and taking care that it being once distinguished, it may not again be confounded shall carrie up to the Bookkeeper the Account of each mans parcell, who shall accordingly enter downe in his booke how much of each sorte belongeth to every man which he shall shewe and give a note of to any owner that desires it. This being thus reported by Mr. Deputy some made motion that when the sorting was to be performed, there should be in the house where the Courts are kept a bill set up declaring from day to day whose Tobacco should be sorted to the intent that the owners might be present.",

It was by some also moued that the Sorters might not be Buyers, because it was said, they might therby sett out good Peityworthes for themselues to the preiudice of the Stocke, but vpon debate it was not conceaued that any such inconvenience could followe if good care were vsed; But on the other side it would be an ill leadinge example to debarr any man from beinge a Buyer that would bidd a good price and make good payment. Mr. Roberts moued that there might be Three sorters to euery peell to the intent that if two were of different iudgement the matter might be ended by the Third: This motion was well liked, both for the reason he alledged, and also because it was thought harder to corrupt three then a lesse number wherefore although it would breed more charge, yet it was thought good to followe that order.

Hee said that to the first branch there offered themselues (as he thought to euery mans vnderstandinge,) three mayne exceptions; The first that by this vnrestrained liberty of bringinge in Tobacco from all places as well from Spayne as the two Plantations there would growe here such a generall glutt of that Comoditie as would bringe downe the price to so lowe a proportion as would discourage the Aduenturers and vndoe the poore Planters, the same beinge contrarie to the maine intent of the Contract wch was to raise the price of the Comodity to the generall benifitt of the Plantations. Secondly it beinge averred before their Lls that the meaner sort of Tobacco in Spaine may be bought for the value of 6d or 12d at the most, and on the other side it beinge alledged by the pty opposite to the Contract that the Tobacco of the Plantations could not possiblie be affoorded at lesse then 2s 6d the pound, it did necessarily followe that the Spanish Tobacco would be much cheap then the Tobacco of the Plantations and consequently would be first vented (to the extreame detriment if not beggeringe of all the poore Planters especially consideringe the nature of the Comodity wch could not be longe kept without wast and perishinge.) A Third reason he said might be drawne from the wisedome of the late Assembly of Parliament where it beinge found by euident proufe and the Spanish Marchaunts confession that the Importation of Spanish Tobacco into this Realme had hindred the Importacon of Spanish money what by the price of the Tobacco itselfe and what by the vndersellinge thereof of our English Comodityes for the sudden buyinge vp of the Spanish Tobacco to the value of 100000l sterlinge by the yeare, wch hauinge so [226] continued for 10 or 12 yeares then last past, was conceaued to be one principall cause of the scarcity of money in this Realme, and therevpon the lower howse framed and passed a Bill.",

Touchinge the second branch of Sr. Iohn Wolstenhomes Proposition as it was made at the Counsell bourd (for in other places he had made it otherwise) that the Companies and Colonies should paye to the vse of his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 or the ffarmors of his Custome and Impost 12\u1d48 for euery pound of Tobacco imported, it seemed that it was much more then that Commodity could beare if the benifitt of the sole Importation were taken from them; ffor if it were true w\u1d57\u02b0 the Obiectors against the Contract avouched that the Tobacco in the Colonyes stood them in 2\u02e2 6\u1d48 the pound, there beinge added thereto this 12\u1d48, and 6\u1d48 at the least more for freight and other publique charges of the Plantations it followed that vnlesse the Tobacco were sold one with another at 4\u02e2 the pound, the Companies and Collonies should be loosers by it of their principall; whereas contrariwise there seemed no probable apparance, that in so great a glutt of Tobacco and the meaner sort of the Spanish Tobacco beinge so cheape and the Commodity beinge diuided into so many hundred\u1d48 of hand\u1d48, that euer it would be sold at aboue 12\u1d48 or 2\u02e2 the pound at the vttmost and this he said was confirmed by the experience of sundrie later yeares, wherein our Tobacco one with another had not bin sold at aboue that proportion: And although the Planters [227] could afford their Tobacco at 12\u1d48 p pound in the Plantations, yet it is cleare that this charge of Tweluepence and 6\u1d48 more must need\u1d48 cause that all they w\u1d57\u02b0 dealt in that Commodity should liue in a continuall losse to their vtter consumption, a veiwe whereof might be taken he said in the late great Magazine w\u1d9c\u02b0 beinge comitted into the hand\u1d48 of a wise and prouident Director, after 6; yeares con-",

But howsoever it should please the Lords to deliver their command whether simply with a grace annexed for the sole Importation as in the Spanish Dominions for his part he would always be the Son of obedience and doubted not but the Companies would inform themselves accordingly: Howbeit he thought it the part of well ordered duty both to yield obedience to the Superiors command, yet in case of impossibility or public mischief that might ensue, to give up a true information both of the one and other.

Which manner and order the Court exceedingly approued and accordingly proceeded first therefore it was considered and argued whither the sole Importation of Tobacco vizt. That none should be brought but from the Plantations (which Sr. Edwin Sandys said was the foundation of the contract) together with the inhibitinge the plantinge thereof in England and Ireland were absolutely necessarie: This proposition of sole Importation was after much debate and examination found to be so absolutely necessarie for the Companies as thereon depended the verie life and subsistence of the Plantations.

Thirdly Sr Edwin Sandys proposed to the consideration of the Companie, what retribution they would giue to the Kinge in case his Ma should graunt vnto them the benifitt of sole Importation and discharge the Contract of the said Couenant of bringinge in\u201480000 waight of Spanish Tobacco for without a Retribution there was litle hope or reason to expect so great a fauor of his Ma.

First that in former times, the Gouernment was soe mild & moderate, as a multitude of Aduenturers were brought in; but now there was much oppression and iniury offred both to Aduenturers & Planters. Secondly that whereas formerly things were carryed quietly both here and in the Plantacions; now there was nothing but contentions & dissentions to the ruyne allmost and ouerthrowe of the Plantacions.

During these 4 last years there hath been expended in setting up of Iron Worke (the Oare whereof is there in great plenty and excellent) above Five Thousand pounds: which worke being brought in a manner to perfection was greatly interrupted by the late Massacre, but ordered to be restored again with all possible diligence.

And for those yt were elected to the two great Salaries against which they doe most object itt is certaine that both in publique and private att sundry times they used all possible endeavour and industry to keep themselvs from being chosen butt the experience the Companies had of their faythfullnes and abilities made them to be chosen, and so in a manner forced them to this imployment against their willes.

And after all these obiections and clamours against them the Last Quarter Courts vppon a longe and full debate did fully conclud and confirme the Offices Officers and Salaries in the same manner & forme as in the Quarter Courts before they had been agreed on. Lastly wheras they fortifie their Clamours with the greatnes of the Salary (vizt) 2500 li per Anni that is untrue for to all the Officers chosen by the Companies there was onely allotted Seauenteen hundred pounds per Anni The other 800 li was layd by for such necessary occasions as could not be avoyded and this 800 li was in the iudgment of the Lords Treasurer a proporcon rather too little then too great: But out of all your Majesty by the Contract was to pay a third parte, and countinge vppon the 1700 li for mere Salary your Majesty's Third is neer 600 li, and the proporcon intended to be layd on the Spanish Tobacco would have saved 600 li more: Soe that the charge remayninge to the Companies would not have amounted at the most but to 600 li: and that would easily have bin defrayed by the imposigon of a penny the pound of Tobacco: And yett this small charge muste not be vnderstood to be laid by the Companies duringe the wholl seaven years of the Contract but onely for one yeare beinge of all other the moste difficult; Soe that if they had found itt too heavy they might for the next year have altered their course, and eased their charge if they found it either possible or convenyent.\n\n2 The Second obiection is that the Courts are ouerswayed, and perticularly were soe in this buisines of the Contract by informinge the Courtes that itt was prest vppon them by the Kinge.

It was by a general erection of hands (no one dissenting) denied. And after, in the Courts of the 5th of March, upon occasion that by some, the day before at the Counsell Table, it was said that men were overawed to give their consent for the Contract, it was again put to the question, and by a general erection of hands, no one dissenting, denied as before, and also further affirmed that this matter was carried fairly, and by strength only of reason appearing to the Court and not otherwise. The Contract in respect of importation from the Plantations only was ever propounded to the Court as a matter of great grace and favour from your Majesty. And in the treaty about it with the Lord Treasurer, who was the first proposer of it, when the retribution of a third was by him urged as also the bringing in of 80 Thousand weight of Spanish Tobacco in two years: The Committees by the Court appointed to negotiate this business with the Lord Treasurer used all their endeavour to bring this Third to a Fourth, and against the Importation of Spanish Tobacco gave his Lordship eight reasons in writing, but neither of these two desires were entertained and so the Committees returned their Labours unto the Court, declaring unto them that upon these Terms and no otherwise they might have the Sole importation which the Courts taking into their most serious Deliberation, considering in what case they had been in former years, sometimes forbidden by reason of other Contractors to bring in any Tobacco, sometimes commanded to bring in all, they conceived that by entertaining this bargain thus, though it were not so good as they desired, yet comparatively they should be in a better state than they have been heretofore: And so afterwards upon this only reason the Contract hath been confirmed by six several Quarter Courts. The third objection is that these persons upon whom these intentions are unjustly laid, when they could not carry matters by plurality of voices, did draw on and spin out the Court till eleven o'clock at night. By what means they that were against some parts concerning the Managing of the Contract, being over-wearied with so long sitting, did depart. It is true that this day here meant the Court sat till about ten o'clock, but upon these Occasions. There were divers long Courts to be read, principally concerning the offences of Mr. Wrote, who that day was to receive the judgment and censure of this Quarter Court, and the very handling of this business continued till after seven o'clock.",

[258] But this Day havinge communicated all the Articles of the Contract with the Lords of the Privy Counsell about 5 a Clock at night hee sent it unto us by Sr. Arthur Ingram, signed with his hand entire as before only with this intimation that whereas before the Companies were to have had forthwith a Proclamation for the sole Importation by the Companies and for restrayninge of bringinge in all other Tobacco then that of the Plantations, saving that within 2 or three years they were enioyned to bringe in 80 Thousand weight of the best Spanish Tobacco: The Companies were now desyred to be content to forbeare the publishinge of this Proclamation though concluded on by the Contract for three or fower monneths: And this at that time beinge a new Proposition, but such a one as hadd the weight to make the bargaine either fall or proceed and that beinge the last day wherein by the Patent and orders of the Companies they are enhabled to conclud buisines of that nature unless they should have deferred them for more than a Quarter Court of a year longer, the debate of this was now necessary and beinge long was another occasion of the Court continuance. And the Contract with this new Proposition beinge againe confirmed the Offices, Salaries and Officers in respect of objections and new Propositions then offered and severally wayed were againe to be debated and putt to the question and soe to be either confirmed (as they were) or else altered and that of necessitie at this time because they expected instantly the cominge in of great quantitie of Tobacco from Virginia and the Somer Islands, and another Courte could not have the power to doe it, And these were the only and true causes of the continuance of these Courts this Day so longe. And that cause which is intimated by the Objection is utterly untrue, for though padventure some departed before the rysinge of the Courte yett not one that opposed the Conclusions and former Acts of Courts went away and at the very last besides divers Noblemen, and knights when the question was put there were about a hundred persons. It hath bin obiected, that in the time when this Contract was first to be concluded the Courts were on purpose put off Seauen weekes together, by reason that some Planters that were shortly to goe away might not have opertunity to Complaine against it.

Most just because these plantations though furthered much by your Ma\u1d57\u02b8 grace yett being not made att your Ma\u1d57\u02b8 charge or expence but cheifly by the private purses of the Adventurers they would never have Adventured in such an Action wherein they interress their owne fortunes if in the regulating and governing of their owne busines their owne votes had been excluded. And most profitable for the advanceing of the Plantation because of the great supplies which the necessities of the people there often require and cannot be sent but by the purses of many, who [261] if a few had the managing of the busines would and that not without reason leave them unsupplyed: And whereas they cry out against Democraticall and call for Oligarchie they make not the Government thereby either of better forme or more Monarchicall. And to discerne what is the judgment of a Company if there be not unanimity there is no way but by pluralitie of voyces and if pluralitie of voyces were not there would scarce att any time in any poynte be unanimity in any Assembly, that unanimity that is proceeding for the most part from Dispaire of prevayling in their private opinions or from shame to Discover opposition to publique good. But this objection sufficiently Discovers that they desire to drawe all things into their owne power to which end there hath of late been a conspiracy plotted in the Summer Ilands and undertaken to be prosecuted here by the Governor and Captaine Butler who is newly returned wherein hee findes correspondencie here at home by some who have openly professed, that they desire the same.

And Answere for the first Plantation which is Kiccoutan against which (if any be) most exception may be made, it is every way soe well disposed that in that place well gouerned men may enioy their healths and live as plentifully as in any parte of England or other his Ma: Dominions, yett that there are Marishes in some places wee acknowledge; Butt soe as they are more Comodious for diuers good respects and vses then if they were wantinge. As for Boggs wee knowe of none in all the Country and for the rest of the Plantations as Newports News, Blunt poynt Wariscoyake Martins Hundred, Paspahey and all the Plantations right ouer against Iames Citty, and all the Plantations aboue these which are many they are verie fruitfull and pleasant Seates, free from Salt Marishes beinge all on the fresh River and they are all verie healthfull and high Land except Iames Citty which is yett as high as Debtforde or Radclyfie.\n\n2: I founde the shores and sides of those parts of the Mayne Riuer wher our Plantations are setled euery wher soe shallow as noe Boates can approach the shores soe that besides the difficulty daunger and spoile of goods in the Landinge of them, the people are forced to a Continuall wadinge & wettinge of themselues and that in the prime of winter when the Shipps commonly arriue, and therby gett such vyolent surfetts of colde vppon colde as seldome leaue them vntill they leaue to liue.\n\n2: That generally for the Plantations att all times from halfe ffloud to halfe ebb any Boate that drawes betwixt three and 4 foote water may safely com in & Land their Goods dry on Shore without wadinge & for further Cleeringe of these false obieccons the Seamen there doe att all times deliuer the goods they bringe to the Owners dry on Shore, wherby it plainely appears not any of the Country people there inhabitinge are by this means in daunger of their lives, And at a great many of Plantations belowe Iames Citty and allmost all aboue they may att all times Land dry.\n\nThis document is in the handwriting of Nicholas Ferrar\u2019s assistant, Thomas Collett (?).",
    "1030": "Answere. 382 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nThe new people that are yearly sent over which arrive here for the most part very unseasonably in Winter, find neither Guest house, Inne, nor any the like place to shroud themselves in at their arrival, no not so much as a stroke given towards any such charitable work so that many of them by want hereof are not only seen dying under hedges & in the woods but being dead lie some of them for many days Unregarded & Unburied.\n\nTo the first they Answere that the winter is the most healthfull time & season for arrival of new Comers. True it is that as yet there is no Guesthouse or place of entertainment for Strangers. But we aver that it was a late intent and had by this time been put in practise to make a general gathering for the building of such a Convenient house which by this time had been in good forwardness had it not pleased God to suffer this Disaster to fall out by the Indians. But although there be no public Guesthouse yet are new Comers entertained and lodged & provided for by the Governor in private houses; And for any dying in the fields (through this defect) & lying unburied, we are altogether ignorant, yet that many die suddenly by the hand of God, we often see it to fall out even in this flourishing & plentiful City in the midst of our streets, as for dying under hedges there is no hedge in all Virginia. [276]\n\nThe Colony was this winter in much distress of victual so that English meal was sold at the rate of thirty shillings a bushel their own native Corn called Maize at ten and fifteen shillings the bushel, The which howsoever it lay heavy upon the shoulders of the Generality it may be suspected not to be unaffected by some of the chief, for they only having the means in these extremities to trade for Corn with the Natives do hereby engross all into their hands and so sell it abroad at their own prices, & myself have heard from the mouth of a prime one amongst them that he would never wish that their own Corn should be cheaper among them than eight shillings the bushel.\n\nTrue it is that English meal hath of late since the Massacre been sold for Ten pounds of Tobacco the bushel which no understanding man can there value above fifteen shillings sterling and here we find (without a Massacre) by the judgment of God for our murmuring at plenty Wheat hath this year been sold and still is in many places at three times the rate it hath borne within two or three years last past: And again Indian Corn hath heretofore commonly been sold after the rate of five shillings the bushel, And farther meal bore so high a price this year as it cost ready money in England together with the freight & other charges near upon twelve shilling so that if it were sold at Ten pounds of Tobacco there will not be gained twenty in the hundred.",
    "1031": "APRIL 30, 1623\n\nThe Houses are generally the worst that ever I sawe; the meanest Cottages in England beinge every way equall (if not superior) with the most of the best. And besides, so improvidently and scatteringly are they seated one from another, as partly by their distance but especially by the interposition of Creeks and Swamps, as they call them, they offer all advantages to their savage enemies and are utterly deprived of all sudden recollection of themselves upon any terms whatsoever.\n\n1. First, that the houses there were most built for use and not for ornament, and are so far from being so mean as they are reported, that throughout his Majesty's Dominions here, all labouring men's houses (which we chiefly profess ourselves to be) are in no wise generally for goodness to be compared unto them. And for the houses of men of better Rank and quality, they are so much better and convenient that no man of quality without blushing can make exception against them. Again, for the Creeks and Swamps, every man there that cannot go by Land hath either a Boat or a Canoe for the Conveying and speedy passage to his neighbour's house. As for Cottages, there are none in Virginia that they know.\n\n2. I found not the least piece of fortification, Three Pieces of Ordinance only mounted at James City and one at Flowerdue Hundred, but never a one of them serviceable. So that it is most certain that a small Bark of one hundred Tuns may take its time to pass up the River in spite of them and coming to an Anchor before the Town may beat all their houses down about their ears, and so forcing them to retreat into the Woods may land under the favour of their Ordinance, and rifle the Town at pleasure.\n\n3. It is true there is as yet no other artificial fortifications than Pallisadoes, whereof almost every Plantation hath one, and divers of them have Trenches. And this last year Capt. Each was sent for that purpose. As for great Ordinance, there are four pieces mounted at James City and all serviceable, there are six mounted at Flowerdue Hundred, all of them likewise serviceable, and three mounted at Kiccoutan and all of them serviceable. There are likewise at Newport News three, all of them serviceable. There are likewise at Henrico seven pieces and at Charles Hundred two, and in other places, besides Fowlers and Murders at divers places.\n\n4. Expecting according to their printed Books a great forwardness of divers and sundry Commodities, at my arrival I found not any one of them so much as in any towardness of being, for the Iron works were utterly wasted, and the men dead.

And wee doe further answer that this Country is a moste fruitfull Country, & doth certainly produce divers rich Commodities. Itt is true that the Ironworks are wasted & the men dead, but that was by the Massacre which if itt had not happened ther had been a good proofe of that Commodity. for the works were in a very great forwardnes.

The answer is that this Information or objection does strongly reflect upon the objector himself for if it be true which we deny not save only for Iron that some samples of these Commodities by the Industry of Sr. Tho: Dale were sent home in the 9th and tenth year of those 12 first years; how happened it that in the last two years under the Government of Capt.
