The Court was informed of Mr. James Bagg of Plymouth who hath divers times taken great pains for the Company and laid out much money as appeareth by his Accounts well approved by the Auditors and may hereafter also pleasure them in divers kinds and therefore to gratify him he may have some land given him; Whereupon it was agreed to be put to the question whether he should have four shares or five which by erection of hands was ordered to be five. A Petition exhibited by Mr. Wrote and Mr. Berblock concerning the Company's suit against Mr. Wye being read was allowed agreeing it should be sealed by the Council Seal and signed by the Secretary. Whereas three standing laws were the last Court presented to be read according to order from the Committee and Council, Mr. Treasurer signified that there was a mistake of a clause in one of them being a standing Law already enacted formerly as well and rather better than this Whereupon this clause was agreed to be left out. It was agreed upon the motion of the last Court that the standing Orders shall presently be put in print and annexed to a book newly come out by order from the Council, which book shall be given to every one of the Court this afternoon. Mr. Treasurer signified that he acquainted the last Court of surrendering Southampton Patent and taking a new one this day but it was not ready and therefore it should be deferred till the next Quarter Court.

They leaue it to his Lps: graue consideration whither the forbiddinge to plant Tobacco in England: and the commaundinge thereof to be brought in from a forraigne Country, beinge conceaued to haue bin a chiefe cause of the want of money in this Realme would not be greivous to the English Subiect, and greatly preiudiciall to the Patentees in their reputacion.\n\nThey saye that the proportion mentioned in the Proposition of 60000 waight seemeth verie excessiue, and more then was brought in, in diuers of the said seauen yeares, when there was no restrainte at all for bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco.\n\nThey conceaue that this Proposition may in effect clearely crosse the two mayne ends proposed to this Contract, namely the proffitt of his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 and the benifitt of the Plantations: seeinge that it is generally knowne and confessed, that there hath bin in these later yeares as much Tobacco vnduely brought in without payinge of Custome, as that wch hath bin orderly brought in by the Marchant wch if it hath heretofore bin 12\u00b0 out of the Kings waye will nowe vpon this Contract ||will|| be neare ten times as much, and the onely waye to auoyde that fraude and mischiefe, is the certaine discerning of the seuerall kinds of Tobacco, wherein there can be no erro\u2019: Whereas contrariwise vnder the coulo\u2019 of Spanish Tobacco, it wilbe vnpossible to avoide the stealinge in of ten times as much, whereof the former Patentees haue had deare experience, So that if his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 should gaine by that Proposition some thousand of pounds one way, he should run hazard of loosinge twice as much by wronginge the great Contract, and this reason is of like force touchinge the benifitt of the Plantacions wch together with his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 proffitt must stand and fall growe and diminish.

And touchinge the Plantations, it appeareth most manifestly by the experience of this yeare that the bringinge in of that quantitie of 60000 waight hath kept downe the Virginia and Suffer Ilands Tobacco at the same rate as formerly: So that by the admittinge of this Proposition the Plantations should depart with one Third of their Tobacco without any retribuzon in the price as was at first proposed.

But touching the Patent of Garbelling, which the Committee desired to be discharged of, The Lo: Treasurer said it was out of his power to recall what his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 had already granted under his great Seal to certain private gentlemen: with whom notwithstanding he made no question they might compound upon reasonable conditions, or otherwise they had liberty to stand upon the alleged privilege of their Patent and benefit of the common law (if they conceived that might help them) for his lp: hereupon very nobly professed he did urge this present Contract no further, than as it might well stand with the future good of both the Plantations. Whereupon the matter being taken into debate by the Companies, Some conceived, that as it would be grievous unto the Adventurers",
    "703": "JULY 1, 1682\n\nso would it be vnto the Planters in Virginia, nor could it well stand with the safety of the Plantation, if the Planters vpon halfe proffitte be forced to paye also a third part of their Tobacco to the Kinge: But it was answeared by reason they were to paye the Kinge in the Specie of Tobacco and not in money and for all other duties to paye only the mediti of the Custome (if they might therewithall be discharged of the matter of Garbellinge) it was verie probable (the buissines beinge duly managed) they should not be in worse case then they were before: Wherevpon some moued that the contract with his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 might be condi\u00e9onall with proffer of a fourth part forthe present vntill they might be eased of their Couenant for bringinge in Spanish Tobacco and also quitt of the said Patent of Garbellinge: And others moued that a Clause in this Contract might be inserted to free them from it, but it was answeared that a Precedent Patent could not be infringed by any after Graunt nor was it held fitt so much as to question the pluiledge of their owne Patent w\u1d9c\u02b0 was sufficient against it. After w\u1d9c\u02b0 debate with some other allegatons tendinge to impugne the said Contract, and the Lord\u1d49\u02e2 that were present desired that the buis- sines might be proceeded within an orderly fashion, and brought one waye or other to a certaine Conclusion and resolu\u00e9on; S\u1d57\u02b3 Edwin Sandys herevpon moued that for a more orderly proceedinge herein, the whole buissines might be reduced to certaine heades, and that each of those heades might be throughly debated of, and the Court to passe their iudgement seuerally vpon each, and finally in con- clusion vpon the whole bargaine of the Contract: And he said that he had obserued in the reasons and Allegac\u00e9ons, w\u1d9c\u02b0 had bin hetherto made, that some of them did directly impugne the Contract or some branch thereof, and some other did moue questions onely of certaine difficulties that seemed to depend vpon the orderinge and managinge of this buissines, w\u1d9c\u02b0 difficulties seemed not to be of that importance as to disharten men from it if the Contract it selfe were assented vnto: And therefore to proceed with the Contract it selfe, he first acquainted the Companie that this matter of contractinge for the sole Importation of Tobacco had moued originally from an offer made for the same, by the then Gouernor and Deputy of the Com-",
    "704": "68 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\npany for the Summer Ilands who had bin also Treasurer and Deputy for this Company as was openly delivered at the Counsell Board in presence of himselfe and many others of the Company nowe in Court. Whereupon it was conceived by reason of the quality of the persons the offer had moved from the two Companies; which at the same time was absolutely denied and disavowed by the Members of both Companies then attendinge their lp'. But the first mover of this Contract for the sole Importation cominge to no higher an offer then of 10000 li Rent by the yeare, It was undertaken by others, namely Sr. Thomas Roe and his Associates at a much greater rent, who for the raising thereof, besides their Patent of Contract for sole Importation procured also a Proclamation from his Ma\u201c, straightly inhibitinge all others to bringe in any Tobacco into this Realme without the Patentees license, which was the cause of the Companies then attendinge their lp*. Whereupon a gracious Reference from his Ma\u201c they obtained liberty notwithstanding the said Proclamation to bringe in 55000 wt from the two plantations whereof the Company for Virginia did bestowe their whole part upon the other Company. Sr. Thomas Roe's yeare beinge ended, the same Contract hath bin undertaken this yeare by Mr. Iacobe, though not at the same rent who contrariwise hath procured (as he hath bin informed,) a commandment to the Company to bringe in all their Tobacco, which it seemed was to the no greater content of the Companies, then the first restraint from bringinge in any at all without license: These troubles as they all knew had befallen the Company by reason of those Contracts for sole Importation, and that not long after in thankfulness to his Ma\u201c for prohibitinge the planting of Tobacco in this Realme (which was done without any suite from the Companies) The Company of Virginia had yealded for 5 years to double their custome. But the Lord Treasurer hereupon observing what grievous molestations the Companies have sustained from time to time in their proceedings by reason the said Contract was managed by others, did therefore nowe make offer thereof, to the Companies, that if they so liked, and should finde it to be for the good of their said Companies and the Plantations they might nowe contract with his Ma\u201c for the",

After longe pause and much dispute, it was desired at length it might be put to the question w\u1da6\u1d57\u02b0 was proposed in this manner. [39] Whither the Companies of Virginia and Sumer Ilands thought fitt to entertaine this contract with his Ma\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49 for the sole Importation of Tobacco vpon such conditions as should be agreed on or suffer the same to be entertayned againe by some other: Herevnto the Court generally signified their willingnes and consent to entertaine the said Bargaine. The second question proposed by Sr. Edwin Sandys to be considered of, was at what rate this Contract should be concluded vpon, there hauing bin a fourth part of the Tobacco offered to his Ma\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49 w\u1da6\u1d57\u02b0 would not be accepted. In declaration whereof Sr. Edwin Sandys further signified, that my lo: Treasurors speach was that seeinge his Ma\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49 proffitt was to be raised onely by Sale of Tobacco and not in certainty of money, he was so to prouide, That the Kinge his Ma\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49 were noe looser by this bargaine: to prevent w\u1da6\u1d57\u02b0 hee hauinge duely calculated the medium of Tobacco that haue bin brought in the last seauen yeares and considered of all circumstances incident herevnto, he said he could demaund no lesse then a Third part of the Tobacco for his Ma\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49. Sr. Edwin Sandys further signified that the Comittee entringe into consideration of this pointe founde by the rate that the Tobacco is nowe sold at that they paid alreadie litle lesse then a Third parte, all charge considered. As for the custome insisted vpon for the Kinge, It was presumed the price of Tobacco would heareby be so much aduanced as would giue the Companie a convenient retribution. The Comittee further informed the Companie that my Lo: Treasuror said that if the Companie shall at any time desire to transporte the",
    "706": "70 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nTobacco which they cannot vent here at home into any forraigne parte, it shalbe free alwayes from Custome. It was further intimated, that it was intended that the King's part of the Tobacco and the Companies shalbe sold together and not deuided till the moneys therevpon be raised. As for the intricacy which was supposed would happen in the sale thereof, in regard of the different goodnes of the Tobacco (whereby it was conceaued men would be the more witixge careles in the makinge and curinge thereof, if once they vnderstand it shalbe sold confusedly together) Answeare was made it should be sorted and valued accordinge to the goodnes: Wherevpon it being agreed to put it to the question whither the Companies did not thinke it better to contract for the sole Importation and sale of Tobacco and yeald a full third part thereof to the Kinge ouer and aboue their parte of auncient custome rather then breake the bargaine with his Ma** The whole Court did generally agree to giue a Third. [40] The third question offered to their consideration by Sr. Edwin Sandys was touchinge the newe Proposition of bringinge in a quantitie of Spanish Tobacco, against which Sr. Edwin Sandys signified the eight reasons lately read were opposed beinge conceaued it would in effect cleare crosse the two mayne endes proposed to this Contract namely his Ma** proffitt and the benifitt of the Plantations But his lo** returninge answeare that this was a matter of so great importance and consequence as could not be dispenced with, The Comittees herevpon did endeauor to qualifie it with such limitations as had bin before recited from which as they had bin also since informed his lo** did not dissent. This pointe beinge a longe time debated by the Companie, a question was moued whither in case the 40000 weight proposed beinge transported into any other forraigne partes and not into England would be allowed the Kinge havinge his Third duely paid him. It was conceaued it must first be imported otherwise it would not satisfy, but yet if then it could not be here vented there was noe doubt, but they might freely export it to the best Markets, Some were also",

At length at the request of the Companie it was put to the question; namely whether the Companies did not thinke it best for them to vndergoe this condition of bringinge in yearely 40000 w\u1d57 of Spanish Tobacco for the two next yeares onely with those other qualifications, w\u1d9c\u02b0 had bin formerly read rather than to breake the Contract intended with the Kinge: The Court did generally declare themselues willing to vndertake it: Provided that casualty at Sea be excepted, and those other conditions graunted that haue bin alledged.\n\nThe next question offered by Sr. Edwin Sandys to their consideration, touchinge the addition of charges, namely the matter of Garbellinge and fraight: Touchinge the first it was alledged by some of the Companie, that it appeared the Companies had two strings to their Bowe, namely the benifitt of the common Lawe, and the power of the Kings Letters Patents formerly graunted to them. It was also informed by other of the Company that this Patent of Garbelling beinge questioned by the lower house at the last meetinge of Parliament was adiudged by all the Lawyers of that house to be a greiuance both in the Creation and (if euer it proceeded so farr) much worse in the execution. Wherevpon it beinge put to the question whether the Companies thought it not fitt to proceed in this Contract and leaue the matter of Garbelling in the State it is rather than otherwise to desist: The Court generally agreed to leaue it so, and to insist vpon the validity of their owne Patent and the benifitt of the common lawe if need be.\n\nThe last question where it was alledged by Sr. Edwin Sandys that the Lo Treasuror consented that the Kinge should beare his Third parte of all other charges after the arriuall of the Tobacco here, at w\u1d9c\u02b0 time his interest vnto that Third did begin, but not to looke backe to any charges preceedent.",
    "708": "72 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nThis pointe beinge throughly debated and with much opposition, The Companie at length desired it might be put to the question: wch was proposed after this manner: Whither they thought it not better to paye the whole fraight of the Tobacco, That is to Saye, aswell for the Kings Third part as their owne, rather then to breake the bargaine with his Ma: the Company by plurality of voices consented to paye the whole fraight.\n\nSr Edwin Sandys likewise moued that for auoydinge difference or questions that might arise on the Kings part about the appointinge of Officers and allowances for their Salaries and for other charges about this buissines, that it might be added to the rest of the Articles, that the Companie may haue power to choose their said Officers, and that their Salaries and all other charges be rated and sett downe by them in their generall Courts and that vpon their Account the entire charges be defalked and allowed.\n\nThese buissinesses beinge thus ordered the last thinge taken into consideration was the reducinge of the whole Contract by writinge into Articles to be presented to the Lord Treasuror the next daye, wch Articles beinge assented vnto by his Lp: are to be offered to the iudgement of the Quarter Court held on Wedensday next to be finally concluded and confirmed.\n\nWherevpon the Court entreated Sr Edwin Sandys to take the paines to drawe vp the said Articles, and beinge perfected the Court humbly entreated the Ea: of Southampton together with Sr Edwin Sandys to repaire to the Lord Treasuror some time to morrowe about the premisses.\n\nA motion was made for diuers Patents to be made readie against the Quarter Court, for wch order was giuen for the drawinge of them: And further ordered that the Patents and some other buissinesses should be read and ordered by the morninge Court that daye.

    "715": "JULY 8, 1619\n\nWhereunto the Company had also giuen their Answeare to Sr. Christo: Perkins (unto whom his Ma\u1d57\u02b8 had referred these petitions) as likewise had answered two other petitions in the name of one Dixon and W\u1d50 Kempe: Also another Petition was exhibited by Captaine Baylie in the name of Captaine Somers wherein he had entitled the Kinge to the Summer Ilands and to 12000\u2113 of Ambergreece whereunto they had likewise made their Answeare, as may appeare by the said Court. After this upon occasion of a petition exhibited to the said Court by Elizabeth Smalley Widdowe for delivery of a fower oxen she pretended unto, in Virginia, There was related the proceeding of the said Widdowe Smalley against Captaine Argall and the cause of her Retraction of what she had formerly complained of to the Kinge in her petition against him, confessing freely that the said Capt. Argall caused that Retraction to be made at the Do\u1d50 Commons refusing to set over her Husbands Executorshippe unto her until She had first set her hand and Seale to that writing: The matter whereof (she said) She did not well understand; Contrariwise she justified her former complaint made to the Kinge against Captaine Argall, protesting she was by no other means moved thereunto but by the wrongs he had done her and that the petition was drawn by a friend of hers at her request dwelling in Tower street. Hereupon Sr. Edwin Sandys took occasion to declare how unworthily Captaine Argall had conceived a suspicion against him as well touching the said Widdowe Smalley (as if he had incited her to this complaint against him,) as also touching some former proceedings held against the said Capt: Argall for depredation of the Colony in the time of his being Deputy Governor. Whereas Sr. Edwin Sandys declared that at the time of his coming to be Treasurer he found the same complaint made against Captaine Argall by Sr. Tho: Smith and Alderman Johnson then Treasurer and Deputy as may appear by their Letters sent to the Lord De: Lawarr and Captaine Argall himselfe charging him particularly with these things which Letters were read and entered in the said Court, whereby Sr. Edwin Sandys said.",
    "716": "80 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nwhen he came to be Treasurer he was tyed both by the Duty of his place and by vpon his oath to bringe those matters to some heade wherewith Captaine Argall stood still charged: In which proceedings he said he had donn nothinge but by the Counsell's direction and advise. Hee further also signified that true it was that one thinge fell out in his yeare of beinge Treasurer namely the sendinge out of Captaine Argalls Shippe both victualled and manned from the Colony into the West Indies whereof complaint beinge made from the Governor and Counsell in Virginia as of an Act that might worke their vtter [47] extirpation, he could no lesse then giue notice thereof accordinge to his oath to the Lords of his Ma\u2018 Priuy Counsell, wherein he did nothinge otherwise then by the direction of the Governor and Counsell and with as much moderation as the cause could possibly beare.

And in regard of the appearance of Damage and danger that might ensue to the Plantations by this newe Proposition the Committees thought fitt likewise, that the whole Contract should be extended, but to three yeares in certaine, and afterward for fower yeares more, Yet so, as the Companies to be at liberty to dissolve the Contract vpon a yeares warninge giuen at the end of the second yeare or any yeare after, All wch proceedings are at large related in the said Court of the 29 of June last.

But Sr. Edwin Sandys signified that the Lord Treasuror had since sent a more fauourable Answeare vnto the Companie touching the same exceptions, for being informed that the Tobacco in Virginia had three seuerall proprietors, as first the Tobacco belonginge to the Companie, Secondly the Tobacco belonginge to perticular Societies and Plantations, Thirdly the Tobacco belonginge to priuate men, (acquired either by purchase or by their psonall Aduenture) the Companie ouer the two later sorts had no power to prohibite or authority to comand them to bringe their Tobacco hither, but were free and at liberty by their lawes and grauntes to carry their Commodities to what markettes they please.

    "762": "NOVEMBER 18, 1619\n\nSecondly, when a review shall be made in Virginia how all men are possessed of their lands, which will be most necessary to be done in regard of the great disorder and licentiousness which men there use in taking out land and not due to them, it will be a matter of great trouble to all private Planters that come not in the Companies Ships to prove that they came over at their own charges, and except they do, that it will be very dangerous and unsafe to the Company to make confirmation of lands to them which perhaps others have better right unto. Thirdly, it is a thing of marvelous great satisfaction to all men whose friends go to Virginia to understand when and how they went: and the contrary is of exceeding discontent and grief, divers persons coming daily from the farthest parts of England to inquire of friends and Kindred gone to Virginia & because there is only notice kept of them that go in the Ships undertaken by the Company, there can be no Account given of the others whereby arises likewise a great disreputation of the Company for want of judgment and providence in their proceedings. [78] Fourthly, the advantage of an uncontrolled going doth invite many lewd and wicked persons to rob and steal from their friends, Masters &c. as hath been found by some examples in those Ships which the Company did not undertake very much to the disreputation of the Action and on the contrary no such thing hath happened in those Ships, that are set forth by the Company, wicked and infamous persons not daring to show themselves so much in the light and yet on the contrary, it hath not been any hindrance to any honest-minded persons who oppressed with poverty and Debts have of necessity and not wickedly been constrained to go. For the redressing of these and many other great inconveniences: The Committees conceive these remedies. First, that it should be published and made known by a law and order that all persons Desirous to go to Virginia should give up their names to the Company and that no Masters of Ships should presume to carry any without giving up the name of the person to the Company. Secondly, that for the receiving of Passengers' names there should be a particular Officer appointed which they conceive fittest to be the Bookkeeper who should towards the going of every Ship attend two or three days in the week at the house where the Courts are kept to receive the names of all such persons as are to go to Virginia. The said Officer shall in a book register every man's name, age, Country, profession, and kindred and likewise whether he go at his own charge or other, for doing whereof he shall have from the party such a fee as the",
    "763": "126 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nQuarter Court shall from time to time order him; And it being a smale matter, it cannot but be gladly giuen of the party in regard that it wilbe his evidence for the settinge out of his land in Virginia. The said Officer shall by euery Shippinge send a Coppie of all the persons names as formerly registred vnto the Gouernor and Counsell of State and from them shalbe yearely returned an Account what and howe the persons come in euery Shippe haue bin disposed and bestowed, to the intent that their friends here vpon enquiry may receaue satisfacton. The said Officer shall not reveale afore the Shippe be gonne the names of any Passenger who shall desire to haue his name kept secrett, except that he knowe him to be a malefactor, vnworthy to goe, and if any shall come to enquire of any such person desiring to be kept secret the said Officer shall demaund of those that enquire the reason of their enquiry and shall therewith acquaint the Treasuror and followe such Directions as he shall receaue from him either for the manifestinge or concealinge of the party. For the Shipps that goe not from London but from other parts they thinke fitt, the master should be bound by his Commission to returne vnto the officer here at London a list of the names as is formerly expressed to be registred here in the Companies booke together with the fee for the same, neither shall they require therefore but one single fee. Which orders beinge read were well liked of and referred to the Quarter Court for confirmation. [79] Sr Edward Sackuill acquainted the Court that Captaine Martin had made greiuous complainte vnto him, that the newe Patent vpon the resignation of his old ordered to be drawne was with such conditions, as he was not able to performe, and verie much to his wronge and preiudice beinge abridged of a great quantitie of land that was due vnto him, and namely that therein he was bound to carrie 100 men, which he could haue no hope to doe by reason of his weake estate: To which Answeare was made that there was not intended a forfeiture of his Patent if that condition were not performed to the full, but onely a quantity of land proportionable to the number of men which he should carry. For the second pointe Captaine Martin pretended he was cut short and abridged of a great deale of land giuen him by his former Patent.",

    "812": "DECEMBER 4, 1622 at 165\n\nFor the second point of Mr. Wrotes former speech vizt upon the Companies bearing a Tenth part in the Adventure, Sr. Edwin Sandys said that the Counsell and Committees had taken that waightie pointe into their serious consideration, and they were of opinion that it was most necessary to engage the Companie in this Iointe Stocke for bringing home the Spanish Tobacco, for that thereby the Adventurers should have the Companies assistance and protection upon all occasions (as need should require) And that this condition was desired by the Adventurers themselves, who without it would not have underwritten in the said Roll; As for the matter of Security (which was so much stood upon) he said the Tobacco itself, as well as the Seale of the Companie should lye at Stake for it. And touching the engagement of mens private estate hereby: therein was no danger; it being clear by lawe that only the goods of the Corporation are lyable to the debts thereof, Concerning which he said he had taken advise of most sufficient Lawyers: And Mr. Caswell said, that Mr. White the Lawyer (who newly was departed out of the Court) having heard this Disputation did affirm that private mens estate could not be lyable to the Debts by the Seale of the Corporation but only the goods of the Corporation itself. Notwithstanding Mr. Wrote still persisted in his former opinion, that this business was not fairly carried nor a due course taken for preparing of matters; but were hastily shuffled over, and that he could not be persuaded but each Member of the Companie (upon grant of the Seale for Security) was bound to make this good, out of his own private estate, alleging that he had likewise asked Counsell of Lawyers whose judgement was as he had delivered. [And was the rather confirmed in that opinion because of the late example of the Muscovy Company.] Whereupon Mr. Alderman Johnson desired the Companie to be wary in giving their Seale for the Security and thereupon cited a case of late time happened unto the Muscovy Companie who being indebted long since and having given their Seale for Security divers Brothers of that Companie were troubled and sued for the same.",
    "813": "166 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nMr Mellinge replied it was true that a leviation for payment of the Muscovia Companies debts was ordered by the Lorde of his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 most honorable Privy Counsell to be made out of the gaines made vpon their seuerall Stocke in the seuerall yeares when those moneyes were supposed to be borrowed and taken vp at interest and not to be laid vpon the whole body of the Companye or them that were not Traders in those yeares or since. [108] But Mr Withers made Aunsweare it was true some were troubled but none of them had therefore paid any thinge, but were freed and cleared thereof: And he added further that the newe Iointe Stocke it selfe was exempted from those former debts: W\u1d57\u02b0 Mr Alderman Iohnson said was by perticuler agreement before the Stocke was begun: Howsoever Mr Withers said he was sure that the priuate Brothers of the Companie were by order of the Counsell-Bourd acquitted and freed from molestation.\n\nMr Deputy said that beside the vnseasonablenes of the Proposition since it could not be revoaked at least till the next Quarter Court the thinge it selfe seemed verie strange to him, for if there were danger to priuate mens estates by reason the Companies beare a Tenth part only; howe much greater danger there was, if the Companie should beare the whole w\u1d57\u02b0 they were bound to doe hauinge taken it vpon them by giuinge of their Seale except priuate Aduenturers as they had begun eased them: Wherevpon he said the Counsell and Committees conceaued that they had donn a verie especiall great Seruice to the Companie so to continue and order the matter: That hauinge taken so great a burthen vpon them, they should be eased of almost all, and the care of one onely Tenth part left vnto them: And if the feare of this Tenth part did trouble men what should the whole doe, w\u1d57\u02b0 otherwise was like to lye vpon the Companies: for whereas Mr Wrote said, that this Clause was the onely cause of the vnwillingnes of diuers to vnderwrite in the said Roll w\u1d57\u02b0 otherwise would haue aduentured largely in the buissines, Mr Deputy said it was a principall clause that invited them that had already vnderwritten and when it was replied that if the Companies had not a part there was one would vnderwrite 500 li Mr Deputy made aunsweare that if the Companies had not a part the...",

Vpon this disputation the Lord Cauendish tooke occasion to informe the Court howe fairely and orderly the Counsell and Com\u0304ittee had proceeded in this buissines: The Lords and the Counsell sitting both forenoone and afternoone the day before the Quarter Court beinge attended also by the Com\u0304ittees the whole day, and that thinges were so seriously and maturely debated as there growinge a difference of opinion in one pointe amongst the Com\u0304ittee Counsell, the Earle of Southampton did perticulerly enquire the opinion of euery one and in the end the resoluGon was made accordinge to the maior part of voices.

Wherevpon the Argument beinge still maintayned with such violence and vnorderlynes against so many good reasons as had bin alledged, Mr Deputy made this open protesta\u00e9on that for his part in reguard he had knowne Mr Wrotes great zeale and forwardnes in the buissines of Virginia, he did not thinke that these thinges were propounded and vrged by him out of an evill minde, nor that they came from himselfe, but from some others who had by wronge informa\u00e9ons and groundles perswaded him to doe what he did, directly with an inten- tion to cause distrac\u00e9on and variances and by iealousies and doubte to hinder the vnderwritinge of the Roll and consequently to drawe the Companie into the Penalty of not performinge that condi\u00e9on, wch if any such evill happned he protested this dayes worke was the cheife occasion: Wherevnto Mr Wrote made answeare that he would not haue Mr Deputy thinke so basely of him as to be so lead by any man, for he protested it was his owne what he spake and not out of any suggestion vnto him: And therevpon vrged againe that Mr Deputy would put his former Proposition to the question: wch if he refused he said the Counsell there present were to doe it.",

But Sr. Edwin Sandys moved, that no Salary might be graunted but by the Court's approbation. Herevpon Mr. Wrote tooke occasion to admonish the Companie to take some tender care in giuinge of Salaries and wished that the Graunt of so great Salaryes at the last deriuatiue Court had bin better considered of before they had passed thereon them consideringe the Companie were in debt already, and so litle meanes left whereby to raise so great a Some as 2500li (as was nowe agreed vpon) to be issued out in Salaries and other charges and consideringe also this was a course contrary to the practise of the East Indy Companie who graunted to their Officers no Sallaries at all vntill there was both meanes to do it and service also performed for it: And said further that whereas vpon the grauntinge of the place of Maister of the ordinance in Virginia heretofore vnto Captaine Martin with the like fees and Proffitts as are accustomed to the like place here in England, Sr. Edwin Sandys opposed the said Patent for that it would haue brought a greater charge vpon the Companie then would be paide beinge notwithstandinge but 400li p An\u0304i, Hee therefore could not see (especially nowe the Company were in a farr worse case) by what meanes, so great a Some as 2500li a yeare could be paide without the vtter vndoinge of the Companie: for he said this great Some must of necessity be raised by an imposicion vpon the Tobacco that shalbe brought in, wch he obserued to be of three sorts, vizt: the Spanish Tobacco, The Companies Tobacco and the Tobacco of priuate Planters wch ought to be free by their Charters, So that what with givinge a Third part to his Ma\u1d57\u1d57 and payinge of other charges for custome, freight and for this newe Imposicion, the poore Planter should scarce haue the one halfe of his Tobacco free to himselfe to liue vpon And",

Mr Wrote replied he ment onely touchinge the Salaries wch buissines (he said) was not committed but carried fowly and disorderly and with much arte surreptitiously and to priuate ends; And that diuers of the Companie did both then and since, as well publiquely, as privately in his hearinge complaine much against it, but durst not speake their mindes freely because they were ouerawed. Mr Withers recalled him, sayinge he was much mistaken to saye thinges were carried fowly: And Mr Treasuror Caswell said, you would not haue said wee were ouerawed if you had bin at Court, you should haue seen what wee durst do: But Mr Alderman Johnson interrupted him sayinge they had Salaries and ought not to speake. Wherevpon Mr John Farrar said that that speach of Mr Wrote was both most vntrue and scandalous, for men at all times might speake freely their mindes, and that they did at this verie Court as one example might shewe it, (when after a longe dispute about the Graunt of lands in the Sumer Islands) the Court was diuided and Twenty of the Companie went on one side, and one and Twenty on the other, All the Lordes Knights and gentlemen beinge on the one side: And this Act shewed plainely what men durst doe, Neither was the Gouernment Tirannicall nor the Companie so silly and simple men as Mr Wrote would make them: where if he had bin present at that Court (and other meetings of the Counsell and Committees) wherevnto he was warned, he would haue seen and heard thinges carried and handled in a fairer manner then he nowe deliuers them to be, and much marueyled he would thus censure the proceedings of the Quarter Court and other meetings whereat he was not but take all vpon hearesay.\n\n[MARGINAL NOTE: A paper touching a similar discussion in the Summer Islands Company is referred to in List of Records, No. 380, Vol. I, page 162, ante.]",

As for Sr. Edwin Sandys lawes he called them noe otherwise then a great Lord did, and said that he had taken paines 40: dayes in examination concerninge the Spanish wrecke and that he was a weary of beinge any longer of any Pollitique body: And further said that seeinge his Lordship was thus displeased with him, he would not trouble that Court where his Lordship was Gouernor but would deliuer vp his Share at the next Summer Ilande Court, Wch if he did, the Lord Cauendish said he would not entreat him to keepe it."
